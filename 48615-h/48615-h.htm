DAUGHTER</span></h2>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I&mdash;<span class="smcap">Eastern Seas</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">My</span> first cruise as a midshipman in
the navy of the United States
began a short month too late for
me to share in the honors of the
Mexican War. In other words,
I came in at the foot of the service,
with all the grades above me fresh-stocked
with comparatively young and vigorous officers.
As a consequence, the rate of promotion was so
slow that the Summer of 1851 found me, at the
age of twenty-four, still a middie, with my lieutenancy
ever receding, like a will-o’-the-wisp, into
the future.</p>

<p>Had I chosen a naval career through necessity,
I might have continued to endure. But to the
equal though younger heir of one of the largest
plantations in South Carolina, the pay of even a
post captain would have been of small concern.
It is, therefore, hardly necessary to add that I
had been lured into the service by the hope of
winning fame and glory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
That my choice should have fallen upon the
navy rather than the army may have been due to
the impulse of heredity. According to family traditions
and records, one of my ancestors was the
famous English seaman Will Adams, who served
Queen Elizabeth in the glorious fight against the
Spanish Armada and afterwards piloted a Dutch
ship through the dangerous Straits of Magellan
and across the vast unchartered expanse of the
Pacific to the mysterious island empire, then known
as Cipango or Zipangu.</p>

<p>History itself verifies that wonderful voyage and
the still more wonderful fact of my ancestor’s life
among the Japanese as one of the nobles and chief
counsellors of the great Emperor Iyeyasu. So
highly was the advice of the bold Englishman
esteemed by the Emperor that he was never permitted
to return home. For many years he dwelt
honorably among that most peculiar of Oriental
peoples, aiding freely the few English and Dutch
who ventured into the remote Eastern seas. He
had aided even the fanatical Portuguese and Spaniards,
who, upon his arrival, had sought to have
him and his handful of sick and starving shipmates
executed as pirates. So it was he lived and
died a Japanese noble, and was buried with all
honor.</p>

<p>With the blood of such a man in my veins, it
is not strange that I turned to the sea. Yet it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
no less strange that three years in the service
should bring me to an utter weariness of the
dull naval routine. Notable as were the achievements
of our navy throughout the world in respect
to exploration and other peaceful triumphs, it
has ever surprised me that in the absence of war
and promotion I should have lingered so long in
my inferior position.</p>

<p>In war the humiliation of servitude to seniority
may be thrust from thought by the hope of
winning superior rank through merit. Deprived
of this opportunity, I could not but chafe under
my galling subjection to the commands of men
never more than my equals in social rank and far
too often my inferiors.</p>

<p>The climax came after a year on the China
Station, to which I had obtained an assignment
in the hope of renewed action against the arrogant
Celestials. Disappointed in this, and depressed
by a severe spell of fever contracted at Honkong,
I resigned the service at Shanghai, and took passage
for New York, by way of San Francisco and
the Horn, on the American clipper <i>Sea Flight</i>.</p>

<p>We cleared for the Sandwich Islands August
the twenty-first, 1851. The second noon found
us safe across the treacherous bars of the Yangtse-Kiang
and headed out across the Eastern
Sea, the southwest monsoon bowling us along
at a round twelve knots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
The double lassitude of my convalescence and
the season had rendered me too indifferent to
inquire about my fellow-passengers. We were
well under way before I learned that, aside from
the officers and crew, I was the only person aboard
ship. In view of the voyage of from five to six
months’ duration which lay before me, this
discovery roused me to the point of observing
the characters of the skipper and his mates.
Much to my chagrin, I found that all were Yankees
of the most pronounced nasal type.</p>

<p>As a late naval officer no less than as a Southern
gentleman, I could not humble myself to social
intercourse with the <i>bucko</i> mates. Fortunately
Captain Downing was somewhat less unbearable,
and had the good taste to share my interest in
the mysterious islands of Japan, as well as my
detestation of China. Even as the low, dreary
coast of Kiangsu faded from view in our wake,
we attained to a cordial exchange of congratulations
over the fact that we were at last quit of the filth
and fantasies of the Celestial Empire.</p>

<p>As we wheeled about from the last glance
astern, Downing pointed over the side with a
jerk of his thumb. “Look at that dirty flood,
Mr. Adams. Just like a China river to try to
turn the whole sea China yellow! Conceited as
John Chinaman himself!”</p>

<p>“Give the devil his due,” I drawled. “Biggest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
nation on earth, and close upon the biggest
river.”</p>

<p>“Aye, and thank Providence, every last one
of their three hundred million pigtails lie abaft
my taffrail, and every drop of that foul flood
soon to lose itself in clean blue water!” He
stared ahead, combing his fingers through his
bushy whiskers, his shrewd eyes twinkling with
satisfaction. “Aye! blue water&mdash;the whole
breadth of the Pacific before us, and Asia astern.”</p>

<p>“Not all Asia,” I corrected. “We have yet
to clear the Loo Choos.”</p>

<p>“The Loo Choos,” he repeated. “Queer people,
I guess. They are said to be a kind of Chinamen.”</p>

<p>“It’s hard to tell,” I replied. “They may be
Chinese. Yet some say the islands are subject
to Japan.”</p>

<p>“To Japan? Then they’ve got good reason
to be queer!” He paced across the deck and
back, his jaw set and eyes keen with sudden resolve.
“By ginger, I’ll do it this passage, sir,
danged if I won’t! I’ve been wanting to see
something of the Japanese islands ever since
I came out to the China seas as a cabin-boy, and
that’s fifty years gone.”</p>

<p>“You’d run out of your course for a glimpse
of the Japanese coast?” I exclaimed, no less incredulous
than delighted.</p>

<p>“More than a glimpse, Mr. Adams. Van<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Diemen Strait is a shorter course than the Loo
Choo passage, and with this weather&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Midst of the typhoon season,” I cut in with
purposeful superciliousness of tone.</p>

<p>The captain of a clipper is as sensitive to any
aspersions on his seamanship as the grayest
master of navigation in the navy. Downing
bit snappily. “Typhoon be damned! I navigated
a whaler through uncharted seas twenty
odd years, and never lost my ship. I’ll take
the <i>Sea Flight</i> through Van Diemen Strait, blow
or calm, sir.”</p>

<p>“No doubt,” I murmured with ambiguous
suavity.</p>

<p>He scowled, puzzled at my smile. “You naval
officers! Commanded my first ship before you
were born&mdash;before I had need of a razor.
What’s more, I’m third owner in this clipper,
and I’ve discretion over my course. The skipper
who carries the first cargo out of a Japanese
port is going to get the cream, and I’ve an idee
the Japs are loosening up a bit. I’m going to
put into Kagoshima Bay, where the old <i>Morrison</i>
tried to land the castaway Japs in ’thirty-seven.”</p>

<p>“She was fired upon most savagely by the
soldiers of the Prince of Satsuma,” I replied.
“Why not try Nagasaki?”</p>

<p>“Nagasaki?&mdash;Deshima!” he rumbled. “I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
no Dutchman or yellow Chinee, to be treated
like a dog. What’s more, it’s too far up the
west coast. No! I’ll chance Kagoshima. That
Satsuma king or mandarin, whatever he is, may
have changed his mind since the <i>Morrison</i>,
or there may be a new one now, with more liberal
idees.”</p>

<p>“Since you’re resolved upon it, skipper, I must
confess I have reasons of my own to be pleased
with your plan,” I said, and at his interested
glance, I told him somewhat in detail of my daring
ancestor Will Adams, the first Englishman ever
to reach the Land of the Rising Sun and the only
European ever made a Japanese noble.</p>

<p>“H’m. Married a Japanese wife, and left
children by her,” commented Downing, and he
grinned broadly. “I must ask leave for you to
land and look up your heathen kin.”</p>

<p>“You forget yourself, sir,” I caught him up.
“Be kind enough hereafter to refrain from impertinence
when speaking of persons related to
me.”</p>

<p>He stared in astonishment. “Well, I’ll be
durned! Two hundred years and more since
your forefather died, you said&mdash;”</p>

<p>“None the less,” I insisted sharply, “my cousins
are my cousins, sir. If there are any of my ancestor’s
Japanese descendants now living, they
are related to me, however remote may be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
degree. Therefore they are entitled to be spoken
of with respect.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll swan!” he muttered. “No offence,
Mr. Adams.”</p>

<p>I bowed my acceptance of his uncouth apology,
but maintained my dignity. “As I have said,
sir, my ancestor was ennobled by the great Emperor
Iyeyasu. Heathen or not, rest assured that his
Japanese descendants, if any survive, are at the
least gentlefolk.”</p>

<p>“No doubt, no doubt,” he grunted. “You’ll
soon have a chance to inquire. I’m going to take
my ship up Kagoshima Bay, fog, shine, or blow.”</p>

<p>He turned on his heel, and ordered the helmsman
to put the ship’s head due east. I went
below in a glow of pleasant anticipation. There
was no mistaking the look in Downing’s face.
Nothing could now shake his stubborn resolve.
I was to see the mysterious Cipango of Marco
Polo and Mendez Pinto, the Iappan of my ancestor,&mdash;the
land that for almost two and a half centuries
had shut itself in from all communication with
the wide world other than through the severely
restricted trade with the Dutch and Chinese at
Nagasaki.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II&mdash;<span class="smcap">In Kagoshima Bay</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">Dawn</span> of the third day found us ten
miles off the north shore of the small
volcanic island that stands second in
the entrance to Van Diemen Strait.
The lurid glare reflected from its
crater into the ascending clouds of smoke had
served as a beacon during the last hours of darkness.
Daylight confirmed the calculations of our
position by the sight of the beautiful smoking cone
of Horner’s Peak, lying twenty-five or thirty miles
to the northeast on the southern extremity of
Satsuma, and the rugged peninsula of Osumi,
ending in the sharp point of Cape Satanomi,
a like distance to the eastward.</p>

<p>The moment our landfall was clear in the
growing light, the <i>Sea Flight</i> came around
and headed straight between the two peninsulas.
A run of three hours before the monsoon, over the
bluest of white-capped seas, brought us well
up into the entrance of Kagoshima Bay, with
Horner’s Peak a few miles off on the port beam,
and the bold, verdant hills of Osumi to starboard.
Close along each shore the sea broke on half-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>submerged
rocks, but the broad channel showed
no signs of reefs or shoals, and Downing stood
boldly in, without shortening sail.</p>

<p>Having none of the responsibility of navigating
the ship, I was able to loll upon the rail and
enjoy to the utmost the magnificent scenery of
the bay. On either shore the mountainous coast
trended off to the northward, an emerald setting
to the sapphire bay, with the lofty broken peak
of a smoking volcano towering precipitously at
the head of the thirty-mile stretch of land-girded
waters. Far inland still loftier peaks cast dim
outlines through the summery haze.</p>

<p>Every valley and sheltered mountain-side along
the bay showed heavy growths of pines and other
trees, among which were scattered groups of
straw-thatched, high-peaked cottages. Many of
the slopes were under cultivation and terraced
far up towards the crests, while every cove was
fringed with the straggling hovels of a fishing
village.</p>

<p>In every direction the bay was dotted with
the square white sails of fishing smacks and small
junks,&mdash;vessels that differed from Chinese craft
in the absence of bamboo ribs to the sails and
still more in the presence of the yawning port
which gaped in their sterns. I concluded that
this extraordinary build was due to the Japanese
policy of keeping the population at home, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
certainly none but a madman could have dreamed
of undertaking any other than a coastwise cruise
in one of these unseaworthy vessels. Another
peculiarity was that not one of the craft showed
a trace of paint.</p>

<p>The majestic apparition of the <i>Sea Flight</i>
in their secluded haven seemed to fill the Japanese
sailors with wildest panic. One and all, their
craft scattered before her like flocks of startled
waterfowl, for the most part running inshore
for shelter at the nearest villages or behind the
verdant islets that rose here and there above the
rippling blue waters. A few stood up the bay,
probably to spread the alarm, but the clipper
easily overhauled and passed the swiftest.</p>

<p>By noon, though the wind had fallen to a light
breeze, we had sailed some thirty miles up the bay
and were within three miles of the volcano, which
stood out, apparently on an island, with a deep
inlet running in on either side. On the Satsuma
shore, across the mouth of the western inlet,
our glasses had long since brought to view the
gray expanse of Kagoshima, rising to a walled
hill crowned with large buildings, whose quaint,
curved roofs and many-storied pagoda towers
recalled China.</p>

<p>All along the bay shores, great bells were booming
the alarm, and crowds of people rushed about the
villages in wild disorder, while the junks and smacks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
continued to fly before us as if we were pirates.
Smiling grimly at the commotion raised by his
daring venture, Downing shortened sail and
stood into the opening of the western inlet
until we could make out clearly with the
naked eye the general features of the city and
its citadel.</p>

<p>So far the lead had given us from forty to eighty
fathoms. When we found thirty fathoms with
good holding ground, Downing decided that caution
was the better part of curiosity, and gave orders
to let go anchor. Hardly had we swung about to
our cable when a large half-decked clipper-built
boat bore down upon us from the city with the
boldness of a hawk swooping upon a swan. The
little craft was driven by the long sculls of a
number of naked brown oarsmen in the stern.
Amidships and forward swarmed twenty or thirty
soldiers, clad in fantastic armor of brass and
lacquered leather, and bearing antique muskets
and matchlocks.</p>

<p>In the stern of the guard-boat fluttered a small
flag with the design of a circled white cross, while
from the staff on the prow a great tassel of silky
filaments trailed down almost to the surface of
the water. Beneath the tassel stood two men with
robes of gray silk and mushroom-shaped hats
tied to their chins with bows of ribbon. I should
have taken them for priests had not each carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
a brace of swords thrust horizontally through his
sash-like belt.</p>

<p>At a sign from the older of these officers, the
boat drove in alongside the starboard quarter.
As Downing and I stepped to the rail and gazed
down upon them, the younger officer flung aboard
a bamboo stick that had been cleft at one end to
hold a piece of folded paper. Downing spun
about to pick up the message. But I, calling
to mind the reputed courtesy of the Japanese,
was seized with a whim to test their reputation
in this respect, and bowed profoundly to
the officers, addressing them with Oriental gravity:
“Gentlemen, permit me to request you to
come aboard and favor me with your company
at dinner.”</p>

<p>Together the two swordsmen returned my bow,
slipping their hands down their thighs to their
knees and bending until their backs were horizontal.
After a marked pause they straightened,
their olive faces aglow with polite smiles, and the
younger man astonished me by replying in distinct
though oddly accented English: “Honorable sir,
thangs, no. To-morrow, yes. You wait to-morrow?”</p>

<p>Before I could answer, his companion muttered
what seemed to be a grave remonstrance. He
was replying in tones as liquid and musical as
Italian when Downing swung back beside me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
“Look here, Mr. Adams,” he grumbled, thrusting
out a sheet of crinkly yellow paper. “Just
like their heathen impudence!”</p>

<p>I hastened to read the message, which was
written, in the Chinese manner, with an ink-brush
instead of a quill, but the words were in
English, as legible and brief as they were to the
point:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“You bring our people shipwrecked? Yes? Take them
Nagasaki. You come trade? Yes? Go. Cannon fire.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Downing scowled upon the bizarre soldiers and
their commanders with contemptuous disapproval,
and pointing to the message, bawled roughly:
“Ahoy, there, you yellow heathen, this ain’t any
way to treat a peaceful merchantman. Must
take us for pirates.”</p>

<p>The younger officer looked up, with his polite
smile, and asked in a placid tone: “You come
why?”</p>

<p>“Trade, of course. What else d’ you reckon?”</p>

<p>“Trade? You go Nagasaki. Thangs.”</p>

<p>“Nagasaki!” growled Downing. “Take me
for a Dutchman? You put back, fast as you can
paddle, and tell your mandarin, or whatever
he calls himself, that here’s an American clipper
lying in his harbor, ready to buy or barter for
tea, chinaware, or silks.”</p>

<p>“Thangs. You go Nagasaki&mdash;you go Nagasaki,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
reiterated the officer, smiling more politely
than ever, and signing us down the bay with a
graceful wave of his small fan. “No get things
aboard. You go Nagasaki. Ships no can load.”</p>

<p>“That’s easy cured,” replied Downing. “Tell
your mandarin I’ll get under way first thing to-morrow
and run in close as our draught will let
us. If we can’t come ’longside his bund, we can
lighter cargo in sampans.”</p>

<p>The officers exchanged quick glances, and the
younger one repeated his affable order with
unshaken placidity: “You go Nagasaki. Thangs.”</p>

<p>Without waiting for further words, both bowed,
and the older one signed to the scullers with his
fan. The men thrust off and brought their
graceful craft about with admirable dexterity.
Again their officers bent low in response to my
parting bow, and the long sculls sent the boat
skimming cityward, across the sparkling water,
at racing speed.</p>

<p>Downing nodded after them and permitted
his hard mouth to relax in a half grin. “That’s
the way to talk to heathen, Mr. Adams. No
begging favors; just straight-for’a’d offer to trade.
You’ll see to-morrow, sir.”</p>

<p>At this moment the impatient steward announced
dinner, and we hastened below with
appetites sharpened by pleasant anticipations.
The more we discussed the courteous speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
and manners of our visitors the more we became
convinced that they had meant nothing by their
notice to leave, but would soon return with a
cordial assent to our proposals.</p>

<p>To our surprise, the afternoon wore away without
a second visit either from the guard-boat or any
other craft. Junk after junk and scores of fishing
smacks sailed past us cityward, but all alike
held off beyond hail. Still more noteworthy
was the fact that no vessel came out of the inlet
or across from the city.</p>

<p>At last, shortly before sunset, we sighted four
guard-boats, armed with swivels, bearing down
upon us from the nearest point of the city. Our
first thought was that we were to be attacked
as wantonly as had been the <i>Morrison</i> and
other ships that had sought to open communication
with the Japanese. But at half a cable’s
length they veered to starboard and began to
circle around the <i>Sea Flight</i> in line ahead,
forming a cordon. It was not difficult to divine
that their purpose was to prevent us from making
any attempt at landing.</p>

<p>That they intended to maintain their patrol
throughout the night became evident to me when,
after lingering over two bottles of my choice
Madeira with the skipper, I withdrew from the
supper-table to my stateroom. The cabin air
being close and sweltering and my blood somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
heated from the wine, I turned down my
reading lamp and leaned out one of my stern
windows. Refreshed by the cool puffs of the night
breeze that came eddying around the ship’s quarters
as she rocked gently on a slight swell, I soon
began to heed my surroundings with all the alertness
of a sailor in a hostile port.</p>

<p>The night was moonless and partly overcast,
but the pitch darkness served only to make clearer
the beacon fires which blazed along the coast
so far as my circle of vision extended. No beacons
had been fired immediately about Kagoshima,
but the city was aglow with a soft illumination
of sufficient radiance to bring out the black outlines
of the guard-boats whenever they passed
between me and the shore in their slow circling
of the ship. The booming of the bells, however,
had ceased, and the only sounds that broke the
hot, damp stillness of the night were the lapping
of ripples alongside and the low creaking of the
ship’s rigging.</p>

<p>An hour passed and I still lolled half out of
my window, puffing a Manila cheroot, when I
heard a slight splash directly below me. It was
a sound such as might be made by a leaping fish,
but in Eastern waters life often depends on instant
vigilance against treachery. I drew back on the
second to grasp a revolver and extinguish the
lamp. Within half a minute I was back again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
at my window, peering warily down into the blackness
under the ship’s stern. There seemed to
be a blot on the phosphorescent water.</p>

<p>“Whoever you are,” I said in a low tone,
“sheer off until daylight, or I will fire.”</p>

<p>The response was an unmistakable sigh of
relief, followed by an eager whisper: “<i>Tojin sama</i>&mdash;honorable
foreigner, only one man come.”</p>

<p>Almost at the first word I knew that my visitor
was the younger officer of the guard-boat.</p>

<p>“You come alone?” I demanded. “What for?”</p>

<p>“Make still, honorable foreigner!” he cautioned.
“<i>Ometsuke</i> hear.”</p>

<p>“<i>Ometsuke?</i>”</p>

<p>“Watchers&mdash;spies.”</p>

<p>“You’ve slipped through the guard-boats on
a secret visit!” I whispered, curiosity fast overcoming
my caution. “Why do you come?”</p>

<p>“To go in ship, honorable sir,&mdash;England,
’Merica, five continents go&mdash;no stop. In boat
to pay, gold is.”</p>

<p>For a moment astonishment held me mute.
Who had ever before heard of a Japanese voluntarily
leaving his own shores? Many as had
been picked up by whalers and clippers in the
neighboring seas, I knew of no instance where
the rescued men had not been either wrecked
or blown too far out to sea to be able to navigate
their miserable junks into a home port. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
thought flashed upon me that the man might be
a criminal. Only the strongest of motives could
have impelled him to seek to break the inflexible
law of his country against foreign travel. But
the memory of his smiling, high-bred face was
against the supposition of guilt.</p>

<p>He broke in upon my hesitancy with an irresistible
appeal: “<i>Tojin sama</i>, you no take me? One
year I wait to board a black ship and go the five
continents.”</p>

<p>“Stand by,” I answered. “I’ll drop you a line.
But bear in mind, no treachery, or I’ll blow you
to kingdom come!”</p>

<p>“Honorable sir!” he murmured, in a tone of such
surprise and reproach as to sweep away my last
doubt.</p>

<p>Having no line handy, I whipped the bedclothes
from my berth and knotted the silken coverlet
to one of the stout linen sheets. The latter I
made fast to a handle of my sea-chest, and lowered
the coverlet through the cabin window, exposing
outboard as little as possible of the white sheet.</p>

<p>“Stand by,” I whispered downward. “Here’s
your line.”</p>

<p>In a moment I felt a gentle tugging at the end
of the line, followed by a soft murmur: “Honorable
sir, pleased to haul.”</p>

<p>Though puzzled, I hauled in on the line, to
which something of light weight had been made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
fast. The mystery was soon solved. The end
of the line brought into my grasp two longish
objects. A touch told me they were sheathed
swords. My visitor had proved his faith by
first sending up his weapons.</p>

<p>I cleared the line and dropped it down again,
with a cordial word of invitation: “Come aboard!
Can you climb?”</p>

<p>“I climb, <i>tojin sama</i>,” he whispered back.</p>

<p>There was a short pause, and then the line
taughtened. He came up with seamanlike quickness
and agility. His form appeared dimly below
me as he swung up, hand over hand. I reached
out and helped him draw himself in through the
window. Pushing him aside, I sought to jerk
in my line. It taughtened with a heavy tug.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” I exclaimed. “You made fast
to your boat. It should have been cast adrift.”</p>

<p>“Boat loose is,” he replied, with unfailing
suavity.</p>

<p>“The line is fast,” I retorted.</p>

<p>I felt his hands on the sheet, and he leaned
past me out of the window.</p>

<p>“Your dunnage, of course!” I muttered, and,
regretful of my impatience, I fell to hauling with
him.</p>

<p>One good heave cleared our load from the boat,
which was left free to drift up the harbor with
wind and tide. The thought that it might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
sighted and overhauled by the guard-boat patrol
quickened my pull at the line. A few more
heaves brought up to the window a cylindrical
bundle or bale, which the Japanese grasped and
drew inboard before I could lend a hand.</p>

<p>My visitor was aboard, dunnage and all, and,
so far as I could tell, he had not been detected
either by the men of the guard-boats or the watch
above us on the poop.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Gentleman with Two Swords</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap1">For</span> a full half-minute I leaned out, listening
intently. No alarm broke the peaceful
stillness of the night. I closed the
window and drew the curtains. Having
carefully covered the panes, I struck a
lucifer match and crossed over to light my large
swinging lamp. Three more steps brought me
to the stateroom door, which I locked and bolted.
Turning about as the lamp flamed up to full
brightness, I saw my guest standing well to one
side of the window, his narrow oblique eyes glancing
about the room with intense yet well-bred
curiosity.</p>

<p>His dress was far different from what it had
been aboard the guard-boat. In place of the baggy
trousers and flowing robes of silk, his body was
now scantily covered with a smock-like garment
of coarse blue cotton, and his legs were wound
about with black leggings of still coarser stuff.
On his feet were straw sandals, secured only with
a leather thong that passed between the great
and second toes. His bare head gave me my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
first chance to view at close quarters the curious
fashion in which, after the manner of his country,
his hair was shaved off from brow to nape, and the
side locks twisted together and laid forward on
the crown in a small gun hammer cue.</p>

<p>All this I took in at a glance as I turned back
towards him. Meeting my gaze, he beamed upon
me with a grateful smile and bowed far over,
sliding his hands down his thighs to his knees
in the peculiar manner I had observed when he
was aboard the guard-boat.</p>

<p>Not to be outdone in politeness, I bowed in
response. “Welcome aboard the <i>Sea Flight</i>,
sir. Pray be seated.”</p>

<p>At the word, he dropped to what seemed to be
a most uncomfortable posture on his knees and
heels.</p>

<p>“Not that,” I protested, and I pointed to a
cushioned locker. “Have a seat.”</p>

<p>He shook his head smilingly, and replied in
an odd Dutch dialect, as inverted as his English
but far more fluent, that he was quite comfortable.</p>

<p>“Very well,” I said in the same language.
“Let us become acquainted. I am Worth Adams
of South Carolina, lately resigned from the navy
of the United States.”</p>

<p>“’Merica?” he questioned.</p>

<p>I bowed, and catching up from under the window
his curved long sword and straight short sword,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
or dirk, I presented them to him by the sheaths.
He waved them aside, bowing and smiling in
evident gratification at my offer. I insisted.
He clasped his hands before him, palm to palm,
in a gesture of polite protest. I drew back and
hung the weapons on the wall rack that held my
service sword. He flung himself across, beside
his bale of dunnage, and plucked at the lashings.</p>

<p>As I turned to him he unrolled the oiled paper
in which the bundles were wrapped. The contents
opened out in a veritable curio shop of
Oriental articles. There were three or four pairs
of straw sandals, two pairs of lacquered clogs,
a folding fan, a bundle of cream-colored, crinkly
paper, a tiny silver-bowled pipe, two or three
small red-lacquered cases, a black mushroom hat
of lacquered paper, and a number of robes, toed
socks and other garments, all of silk and some
exquisitely embroidered in gold thread and colors.</p>

<p>From the midst of one of the silken heaps he
uncovered a sword whose silk-corded hilt and
shark-skin scabbard were alike decorated with
gold dragons. Straightening on his knees, he
held the weapon out to me, his face beaming with
grateful friendship. “<i>Wo&mdash;Wort&mdash;Woroto Sama</i>,
honorable gift take.”</p>

<p>“Gift!” I exclaimed. “I cannot accept so
splendid a gift from you.”</p>

<p>“Exkoos!” he murmured in an apologetic tone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
and holding the sword with the edge towards
himself and the hilt to his left, he slowly drew
it out until two or three inches of the mirror-like
blade showed between the twisted dragon
of the guard and the lip of the scabbard. Pointing
first to the shark-tooth mark running down the
length of the blade and then to a Chinese letter
near the guard, he explained persuasively, “Good,
Masamune him make.”</p>

<p>“The more reason why I should refuse such
a gift,” I insisted.</p>

<p>He rose to his feet and bowed with utmost
dignity. “You him take. Low down Yoritomo
me, honorable son high honorable Owari <i>dono</i>,
same Shogun brother.”</p>

<p>“What! Your father a brother of the Shogun&mdash;of
your Emperor?”</p>

<p>He stood a moment pondering. “Shogun
cousin,” he replied.</p>

<p>“You mean, your father and the Shogun are
cousins?”</p>

<p>He nodded, and again held out the sword. “You
him take.”</p>

<p>“With pleasure!” I responded, and I accepted
the gift as freely as it was offered. A cousin of
the Emperor of Japan should be well able to
afford even such extravagant gifts as this beautiful
weapon.</p>

<p>“My thanks!” I cried, and I half turned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
bare the sword in the full light of the lamp.
Though of a shape entirely novel to me, the thick
narrow blade balanced perfectly in my grasp. Being
neither tall nor robust, I found it rather heavy,
and the length of the hilt convinced me that it
was intended to be used as a two-handed sword
by the slightly built Japanese. I presented it,
hilt foremost, to Yoritomo. “Pray show me, sir,
how you hold it.”</p>

<p>He stared at me in a bewildered manner. I
repeated my request, and thrust the hilt into his
hand. After a moment’s hesitancy, which I
mistook for confusion, he reached for the scabbard
as well, sheathed the sword, and thrust it into his
narrow cotton sash. When he turned to kneel
beside his dunnage, I flushed with anger at what
I took to be a deliberate refusal of my request.</p>

<p>He rose with a wooden chopstick in his hand.
Politely waving me to one side, he stepped out
into the clear centre of the stateroom and bent
to set the chopstick upright on the floor. Even
had the ship been motionless, I doubt if he could
have made the little six-inch piece of wood stand
on end for more than a fraction of a second.
Yet, having placed it in position, he suddenly
freed it and sprang back to strike a two-handed
blow with the sword, direct from the sheath,
with amazing swiftness. The chopstick, caught
by the razor-edged blade before it could topple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
over, was clipped in two across the middle. In
a twinkling the blade was back in its sheath.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” I gasped. “That is swordsmanship!”</p>

<p>I held out my hand to him impulsively. He
bowed and placed the sword on my palm. The
splendid fellow did not know the meaning of a
handshake. Much to his astonishment I caught
his hand and gave it a cordial grip. I addressed
him in my best Dutch, inverting it as best I could
to resemble his own dialect: “My dear sir! You
wish to see the world? You shall travel as my
guest.”</p>

<p>He caught up one of his lacquer cases and opened
it to my view. Within it lay a few dozen oval
gold coins, hardly more than enough to have paid
his passage to New York. There could be no
doubt that he had vastly underestimated the
purchasing value of his coins in foreign lands.
He explained in his quaint Dutch: “The punishment
for exchanging money with foreigners is
death. So also it is death to leave Dai Nippon.
I can die but once.”</p>

<p>“They will never kill a cousin of their Emperor!”</p>

<p>He smiled. “Death will be welcome if I can
first bring to my country a better knowledge of
the <i>tojin</i> peoples and their ways.”</p>

<p>Even an Adams of South Carolina might well
be proud to act as cicerone to an Oriental prince.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Yet I believe I was actuated more by the subtle
sympathy and instinctive understanding that was
already drawing me to him, despite the barriers
of alien blood and thought and language which
lay between us.</p>

<p>“Put up your gold,” I said. “You will have
no need for it. I am wealthy and free from all
ties. You shall travel with me and see the world
as my guest.”</p>

<p>He caught my meaning with the intuition of
a thorough gentleman, and his black eyes flashed
me a glance of perfect comprehension. He laid
down the box of coins and took up one of the silken
garments, with an apologetic gesture at the
coarse dress he was wearing. I shook my head.</p>

<p>“No,” I said. “There’s been no outcry from
the guard-boats, so I’m sure I can stow you away
until we are clear of your country. But it will
be best to disguise you, to guard against any
chance glimpse. What’s more, the sooner you
don Occidental clothes the better, if you wish
to avoid annoyance from the rudeness of our
shipmates. You’re perhaps an inch the shorter;
otherwise we are about of a build, and I’ve a well-stocked
wardrobe.”</p>

<p>While speaking I proceeded to haul out three
or four suits from my lockers, and signed him to
take his pick. The gesture was more intelligible
to him than my words. He bowed, smiled, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
chose the least foppish of the suits. I laid out
my lightest slippers, a tasselled smoking-cap, linen,
et cetera, and drew his attention to the conveniences
of a well-furnished washstand.</p>

<p>He took up and smelled the small cake of perfumed
soap and was about to try his flashing teeth
upon it, when I showed him its use by washing my
hands. At this his smile brightened into delight,
and, casting loose his girdle, he dropped his short
robe from him as one would fling off a cloak.
The leggings and sandals followed the robe, and
he stood before me nude yet unabashed, his lithe
figure like a statue of gold bronze.</p>

<p>Fortunately I was too well acquainted with
the peculiar variations of etiquette and manners
exhibited by the different peoples of the East and
West to betray my astonishment at this exposure.
I poured him the bath for which he seemed so
eager, and politely excused myself with the explanation
that I must provide him with refreshments.</p>

<p>As I had my own private larder in the second
stateroom, I had no need to call upon the steward
for a luncheon, having on hand various sweets,
potted meats, English biscuits, and Chinese conserves,
in addition to my wines. When I returned
with a well-stocked tray, I found my guest struggling
to don his linen over his coat. His relief
was unmistakable when I signed him to lay aside
everything and slip on a loose lounging-robe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
Following my example, he seated himself at
the little folding table. When served, he waited,
seemingly reluctant to eat alone. Accordingly I
served myself, and fell to without delay. At my
first mouthful he also caught up knife and fork
and began to eat with undisguised heartiness yet
with a nicety and correctness of manners that
astonished me. When I expressed my surprise
that our table etiquette should be so similar, he
explained with charming candor that he was but
copying my actions.</p>

<p>I could not repress my admiration. “Here’s
to our friendship!” I said, raising my glass to
him. “May it soon ripen to the mellowness of
this wine.”</p>

<p>I doubt if he sensed the meaning of the words,
but he raised his glass, and his face glowed with
responsive pleasure as together we drank the
toast. The act of good-fellowship seemed to bring
him still nearer to me, and as I gazed across into
his glowing face I could almost forget our differences
of race. In my robe and smoking-cap his
color and the obliqueness of his eyes appeared
less pronounced, and I realized that in all other
respects his features differed little from my own.
True, my eyes were dark blue and his jet black,
and though my nose was rather low between the
eyes, his was still flatter. But below their bridges
our noses rose in the same softly aristocratic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
curve. The outlines of our faces were of a like
oval contour, there was a close similarity about
our mouths and chins, and even our eyebrows
curved with an identical high and even arch.</p>

<p>“My friend,” I said, “do not answer unless
you feel free to explain,&mdash;but I wonder that
you, a relative of the Emperor, should be compelled
to start your travels in this secret manner.”</p>

<p>“Shogun, not Emperor,” he corrected. “Law
over Shogun, too. I travel <i>naibun</i>&mdash;incognito.
Shimadzu Satsuma-no-kami my friend. I teach
<i>Raugaku</i>&mdash;the Dutch learning,&mdash;war ways,
history, engineering. No man know real me at
Kagoshima. Daimio of Satsuma gone Yedo. I
steal aboard. No man know. Shogunate no
punish <i>daimio</i>, my friend.”</p>

<p>“They would punish even the Prince of Satsuma
if they found you had escaped from his province?”</p>

<p>My guest nodded. “Very old law.”</p>

<p>“Yet you would leave the country at the risk
of death?”</p>

<p>His smile deepened into a look of solemn joy.
I give his broken Dutch a fair translation.</p>

<p>“My soul is in the eyes of Woroto Sama. There
is trust between us. I speak without concealment.
The <i>tojin</i> peoples of the west have dealt harshly
with the Chinese. The black ships have destroyed
many forts and bombarded great cities. I fear
the black ships may come to devastate Dai Nippon;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
yet my people know even less of your people
than did the Chinese. The Dutch of Deshima
warn us to heed the demands of the <i>tojin</i> to open
our ports. The officials in control of the Shogunate
shut their ears.”</p>

<p>My lip curled. “The English are a nation
of shopkeepers, and our Yankees are no less keen
for bargains. They will never rest until they
have found a market for their wares in every
country on earth. If they cannot get into your
ports peacefully, sooner or later they will break
in by force.”</p>

<p>“Such, then, is the truth,” he murmured.
“<i>Namu Amida Butsu!</i> I ask only that I may
live to bring back to Dai Nippon a clear report
of the power and ways of the <i>tojin</i> peoples.”</p>

<p>“Nothing could please them more,” I replied.
“Count on me to help you fulfil your noble
mission!”</p>

<p>He thanked me with almost effusive gratitude,
yet with a nobility of look that dignified the
Oriental obsequiousness of his words and manner.
To cut short his thanks, I went out for a second
bottle of wine. He had drunk his share of the first
with gusto. Returning briskly, I caught sight
of my guest’s face for the first time without its
pleasant smile. It was drawn and haggard with
fatigue. Putting aside the wine, I asked him if
he did not wish to turn in. He signed that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
would lie down upon the floor. But I explained
the use of a bed, which seemed an absolute novelty
to him, and bundled him into my berth before
he could protest. He fell asleep almost as his
head sank upon the pillow.</p>

<p>I stowed his dunnage in a locker, and hastened
to extinguish the lamp and open the window,
for the room was suffocatingly hot. As I leaned
out of the window I caught a glimpse of one of
the guard-boats sculling leisurely across the belt
of light between the <i>Sea Flight</i> and Kagoshima.
Yoritomo’s boat had evidently drifted away
through their cordon undetected. Five minutes
later I was outstretched on a locker, as fast asleep
as my guest.</p>

<p>I awoke with what I took to be a crash of thunder
dinning in my ears. But the bright glare of sunshine
that poured in through the stern windows
told of a clear sky. No less unmistakable was the
loud shouting of commands on the deck above
me and the sharp heeling of the ship to port.
The <i>Sea Flight</i> was already under way and her
crew piling on more sail as swiftly as Downing and
his bucko mates could drive them with volleying
oaths and orders.</p>

<p>As I sprang to my feet the explanation of the
situation quickly came in the barking roar of an
old-style twelve-pounder carronade. This was
my supposed thunder. During the night the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Satsuma men had either brought up a gun-boat or
placed a battery on the nearest point of land,
and now they had at last opened fire on the <i>tojin</i>
ship that refused to leave after due warning.</p>

<p>I stared out the nearest window, and sighted
our guard-boats of the night, sculling along in our
wake, not a biscuit’s throw distant. Their gunners
stood by the little swivels, slow-match in hand,
and the soldiers held their antique muskets trained
upon us. But the firing was all from the shore.
A puff of smoke showed me where the carronade
was concealed behind a long stretch of canvas
upon a point near the lower end of Kagoshima.
The ball plunged into the water half a cable’s
length short of us.</p>

<p>Before the gunners could reload, the <i>Sea
Flight</i> drew off on the starboard tack with
swiftly gathering headway, and drew out of
range. The crews of the guard-boats were for
a time able to keep their swift clipper-built craft
close astern, but the ship, once under full sail,
soon began to outdistance her pursuers.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Japanese became clear
to me when I saw them lay down their arms
without giving over the pursuit. They had no
desire to harm us, but were inflexibly determined
to drive us out of their port. And follow us they
did, though long before we had tacked down
into the mouth of the great bay they were visible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
only through a glass, as little black dots bobbing
among the whitecaps.</p>

<p>Yoritomo had roused from his profound sleep
as we came about for the first time to tack off
the Osumi shore. When I had returned his
smiling salute, he listened to my account of our
flight with quiet satisfaction, and explained that,
since we had not left peaceably, the Satsuma men
were compelled to resort to these forceful measures.
Otherwise their lord, though in Yedo, would be
punished for permitting our ship to remain in
his harbor.</p>

<p>While my guest then took a morning bath, I
closed the door between my staterooms, and ordered
the steward to serve me a hearty breakfast
in the vacant room. When he had gone, I
locked the door and called in Yoritomo, whom
I had assisted to dress in his Occidental garments.
Thus attired, and with my smoking-cap over his
cue, he might easily have passed for an Italian
or Spanish gentleman had it not been for the slant
of his eyes.</p>

<p>After we had breakfasted, we found seats
beside one of the sternports, and spent the morning
viewing the receding scenery of the bay and conversing
in our inverted Dutch. Eager as I was to
make inquiries about my friend and his country,
he showed still greater curiosity regarding myself
and the wide world from which his people had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
been cut off for so long a period. The result
was that by midday I had told him a vast deal,
and gathered in turn a mere handful of vaguely
stated facts.</p>

<p>Meantime the <i>Sea Flight</i>, having tacked
clear of the mouth of the bay, raced down to Cape
Satanomi with the full sweep of the monsoon
abeam. No less to my gratification than my
surprise, Yoritomo proved to be a good sailor, and
watched our swift flight along the coast with
wondering delight. The heavy rolling of the ship
in the trough of the sea affected him no more
than myself.</p>

<p>Before long we cleared the outjutting point
of Cape Satanomi and, veering to port until upon
an easy bowline, drove due east into the vast
expanse of the Pacific. I pointed to the craggy
tip of the cape where the breakers foamed high
on the dark rocks, and rose, with a wave of my
hand. “Farewell to Dai Nippon! Come&mdash;Downing
will be tumbling below for dinner, now
that we are clear of land&mdash;come and meet the
hairy <i>tojin</i>.”</p>

<p>Yoritomo bowed and, with a last glance at
the fast-receding cape, followed me out into the
passage. We found Downing already at his pork
and beans. But he paused, with knife in air,
to stare at my companion, gaping as widely as
did the steward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
“Good-day, skipper,” I said. “Allow me to introduce
to you my Japanese cousin Lord Yoritomo.”</p>

<p>“Cousin?&mdash;lord?” he spluttered. “Danged
if he’s not the first danged stowaway I ever&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You mistake,” I corrected, “I invited the
gentleman aboard as my guest for the passage.
He will share my staterooms, and you are to look
to me for his passage money.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a different matter, Mr. Adams,”
grunted Downing. “If you’re fool enough to&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mason,” I called sharply to the steward,
“lay a plate for His Lordship.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV&mdash;<span class="smcap">Yoritomo’s Betrothed</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">As</span> this is not an account of the travels
incognito of my friend Yoritomo, I
do not propose to give even a <i>résumé</i>
of our trip to America and our European
experiences. Nor shall I give
the particulars of the family dissension that
estranged me from home and, to a degree, from
my country.</p>

<p>Enough to say that, despite our incongruous
and mutually incomprehensible mental worlds,
the Autumn of 1852 found me bound to my
Japanese <i>protégé</i> and friend by indissoluble ties
of sympathy and love. Strange and inverted as
seemed many of his ideas to our western ways
of thinking, he had proved himself worthy of
the warmest friendship and esteem.</p>

<p>Considering this, together with my longing for
adventure, and my freedom from all the ties of
family, acquaintance, and habit that bind a man
to his country, it will not be thought extraordinary
that I at last determined to accompany
my friend on his return to Japan. My decision
was made at the time when he was spurred to
redoubled effort in his studies of the Occident by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
the news that the proposed American expedition
to his country was at last approaching a consummation
under the vigorous superintendence
of Commodore Perry.</p>

<p>It was then my friend told me, with his ever-ready
smile, that, should the law be rigidly
enforced against him upon his return, he would be
bound to a cross and transfixed with spears. Yet
under the menace of so atrocious a martyrdom,
he labored night and day to complete his studies,
that he might return to his people and guide
them from disaster upon the coming of the hairy
<i>tojin</i>&mdash;the Western barbarians.</p>

<p>Few could have resisted the inspiration of so
lofty a spirit, the contagion of such utter devotion
and self-sacrifice. When my friend was willing to
give all for his country, should not I be willing to
do a little for the constellation whose brightest
star was my own sovereign State, the great Commonwealth
of South Carolina?</p>

<p>After all, though President Fillmore and Commodore
Perry were Yankees, the flag was the flag of
the South no less than of the North, and I had
served under it. The purpose of the expedition
was peaceful. There flashed upon me a plan by
which I might further the success of the expedition
and at the same time aid my friend in his purpose.</p>

<p>“Tomo!” I cried, “you insist that you must
sail before the American expedition,&mdash;that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
must risk all to reach Yedo and advise your
government to welcome the fleet of my countrymen.
Very well! I will no longer seek to dissuade
you. I will go with you and help you
persuade Dai Nippon to enter into friendly
relations with America.”</p>

<p>He stared at me, startled and distressed. “Impossible,
Worth! They might regard you as a
spy. You would be risking death!”</p>

<p>“In all the world I have one friend, and only
one,” I rejoined. “The thought of parting from
him has been for months a constant source of
anxiety and pain. It is pleasant to be rid of such
distress. I am going with you to Yedo.”</p>

<p>His eyes widened almost to Occidental roundness,
the pupils purpling with the intensity of
his emotion. “My thanks, brother! But it is
impossible&mdash;impossible!”</p>

<p>“At the worst they can only send me packing
in a bamboo cage, to be shipped out of Nagasaki
by the Dutch.”</p>

<p>“That is the usual course with wrecked sailors,
but should you go with me, they might torture
and execute you as a spy.”</p>

<p>“Not with Perry’s fleet in Eastern waters,”
I replied. “I give your government credit for
at least a modicum of statesmanship. Yet even
supposing they lack all wisdom, I choose to take
the risk. There is no room for argument. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
are going, so am I. Why, sir, it’s an adventure
such as I have been longing for all my life! You
cannot turn me from it.”</p>

<p>“If not I, others can and will. The <i>ometsukes</i>
are everywhere. You could not so much as
effect a landing.”</p>

<p>“And you?” I demanded.</p>

<p>“I am Japanese. There is a chance for me
to slip through. But you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Disguised in Japanese dress! Can I not
talk good Japanese? Have I not accustomed
myself to your costume? A little more practice
with the chopsticks and clogs&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Your eyes! In all Japan there is to be found
no one with round eyes of violet blue.”</p>

<p>“I can learn to squint; and have you not told
me of the deep-brimmed hats worn by your freelances,
the <i>ronins</i>? You have said that many
high-born Japanese have faces no darker than my
own, and that brown hair is not unknown.”</p>

<p>“You will risk your life to come with me!” he
protested.</p>

<p>I laughed lightly. “You have so little to
say of your Japanese ladies, Tomo. Perhaps
I wish to see what they are like.”</p>

<p>“That is a jest. I have told you that our women
of noble families are seldom to be seen by
strangers.”</p>

<p>“There are those others,” I suggested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
He gazed at me in mild reproach. “Do not
jest, Woroto. I have seen that you have nothing
to do with the <i>joro</i> of the Occident. You are not
one to dally with those of the Orient.”</p>

<p>“But the <i>geishas</i>&mdash;the artists&mdash;they must
be charming.”</p>

<p>“It is their art to charm.”</p>

<p>“Tomo,” I said, sobering myself, “I know it
is a rudeness to ask, but, pardon me, are you
married?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Is there no maiden of noble family&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“None,” he answered. “There was once a
<i>geisha</i>&mdash;But we men of <i>samurai</i> blood are supposed
to despise such weakness. Since then I have
devoted my life to that which you so generously
have helped me to attain.”</p>

<p>“You have no desire ever to marry?” I persisted.</p>

<p>“We hold it a duty to ancestors and families
for every young man and maiden to marry,”
he replied. “It is not as we wish, but as our
parents choose. More than ten years ago
His Highness the Shogun arranged with my
father that I should marry his daughter Azai.”</p>

<p>“You refused! But of course you were still a boy.”</p>

<p>“You mistake. The arrangement was for the
future. The maiden was then only six years
of age.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
“Six? and ten years ago? Then she is now
sixteen,&mdash;a princess of sixteen! Tomo, you’re
as cold-blooded as a fish! A princess of sixteen,
and you never before so much as hinted at your
good fortune! Of course she is beautiful?”</p>

<p>He gazed at me in patient bewilderment over
the inexplicable romantic emotionalism of the
<i>tojin</i>.</p>

<p>“She is said to be beautiful,” he replied, calmly
indifferent. “I cannot say. I have never seen
her. You know that Japanese ladies do not
mingle with men in your shocking <i>tojin</i> fashion.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Coasts of Nippon</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">At</span> once I set about perfecting myself
in certain practices which so far had
afforded me little more than idle
amusement. The knack of holding
on a Japanese clog or the lighter
sandal by gripping the thong that passes between
the great toe and its mate is not acquired at the
first trial or at many to follow. Still more difficult
is the ability to sit for hours, crouched on
knees and heels, in the Japanese fashion. I
practised both feats with a patient endurance
born of intense desire. Yoritomo had suffered
as great inconvenience while learning to wear
Occidental dress and to sit on chairs.</p>

<p>There were many other accomplishments,
hardly less irksome, in which I had to drill myself,
that I might be prepared to play the rôle of a
Japanese gentleman. For recreation between
times, I devoted my odd hours to cutlass fencing
with an expert <i>maître d’armes</i> and to pistol
practice. For this last I purchased a brace of
Lefaucheux revolvers, which, though a trifle inferior
to the Colt in accuracy, possessed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
advantage of the inventor’s water-proof metallic
cartridges. The convenience and superiority of
this cartridge over the old style of loading with
loose charges of powder and ball only need be
mentioned to be realized.</p>

<p>Yoritomo was so desirous of witnessing the
outcome of President Bonaparte’s manipulation
of politics that we lingered in Paris until the <i>coup
d’état</i> which marked the fall of the French Republic
and the ascension of Bonaparte to the imperial
throne as Napoleon III. Confirmed by this
event in his opinion of the instability, violence,
and chicanery of Occidental statesmanship, my
friend announced his readiness to leave Europe.</p>

<p>The American packets had already brought
word of the sailing of Commodore Perry from
Newport News on November the twenty-fourth.
As his route to China lay around the Cape of
Good Hope, there had been no need to hurry
away on our shorter passage by the Peninsular
and Oriental route across the Isthmus of Suez
and down the Red Sea.</p>

<p>We sailed on January the third, 1853, and, confident
of our advantage of route, stopped twice
on our way, that Yoritomo might study the administration
of the British East India Company
in Ceylon and India and the Dutch rule in Java.
As a result, we did not reach Shanghai until
the end of April.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
It is in point to mention that during the voyage
I gave my friend frequent lessons in Western
swordsmanship and in turn received as many
from him in Japanese fence, using heavy, two-handed
foils of bamboo. Though the Japanese
art is without thrusts, I was taught by many a
bruise that it possesses clever and powerful cuts.</p>

<p>At Shanghai, we found already assembled three
ships of the American squadron, including the
huge steam frigate <i>Susquehanna</i>. The Commodore
was expected to arrive soon from Hong-kong
in the <i>Mississippi</i>.</p>

<p>My plan had been to charter a small vessel,
and run across to the Japanese coast, where we
hoped to be able to smuggle ourselves ashore,
and make our way to Yedo in the disguise of
priests. Owing, however, to the alarm of the
foreign settlement over the victories of the Taiping
rebels in the vicinity of Shanghai, there were few
vessels in port and none open to charter.</p>

<p>We were already aware that, under the strict
orders of the Navy Department, we could not
join the American expedition without subjecting
ourselves to the fetters of naval discipline. As a
last resort and in the hope of gaining the assent
of the Commodore to land us in disguise, we might
have considered even this humiliating course.
But the very object of Yoritomo’s return to his
native shores was to reach Yedo and present his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
case to the Shogun’s government before the arrival
of the foreigners.</p>

<p>Fearful of delay, we hired a Chinese escort
and rode south across country to Cha-pu, on the
Bay of Hang-Chow, the port from which the ten
annual Chinese junks sail to Nagasaki. Though
our escort did not always manage to prevent
their bigoted countrymen from making the journey
disagreeable for the “foreign devils,” we reached
our destination without loss of life or limb.</p>

<p>The vile treatment of the Celestials was quickly
forgotten in the graciousness of our welcome by
the little colony of Japanese exiles whom we found
located at Cha-pu. Careful as was Yoritomo to
conceal his identity from his countrymen, they at
once divined that he was a man of noble rank,
and invariably knelt and bowed their foreheads
to the dust whenever they came into his presence.</p>

<p>The Cha-pu merchants were greatly impressed
by such deference on the part of the proud little
men of Nippon, yet neither this nor my gold
enabled us to obtain passage on one of their
clumsy junks. The five vessels of the summer
shipment to Nagasaki were not due to sail before
August, and the jabbering heathen refused point-blank
to risk the extinction of their Japanese
trade either by advancing the date of sailing
or by chartering a separate junk. Their unvarying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
reply was that no one could land anywhere
in Japan without being detected by the
spies.</p>

<p>One merchant alone betrayed a slight hesitancy
over refusing us outright, and he, after dallying
with my ultimate offer for a fortnight, at last
positively declined the risk. I next proposed
to buy a junk and man it with fishermen from
the Japanese colony. But Yoritomo soon found
that not one of the exiles dared return to Dai
Nippon, great as was their longing.</p>

<p>Mid-May had now come and gone. Hopeless
of obtaining aid from the Chinese, we rode back
overland to Shanghai, agreed that it would be
better to sail with Perry than after him. To our
dismay, we discovered that the American squadron
had sailed for the Loo Choo Islands two days
before our arrival.</p>

<p>In this darkest hour of our enterprise we chanced
upon our golden opportunity. Shortly after our
departure for Cha-pu a New Bedford whaler,
the <i>Nancy Briggs</i>, had put into Shanghai to
replace a sprung foremast. She was now about
to sail for the Straits of Sangar, bound for the
whaling grounds east of the Kurile Islands. I
met her skipper upon the bund, and within the
hour had closed a bargain with him to land us
on the Japanese coast within twenty miles of
the Bay of Yedo. For this I was to pay him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
thousand dollars in gold, and pilot his ship through
Van Diemen Strait.</p>

<p>By nightfall Yoritomo and I were aboard the
<i>Nancy Briggs</i> with our dunnage and had
settled ourselves in the little stateroom vacated
by the first mate. We awoke at sunrise to find
the ship under way down the Whang-po to the
Yang-tse-Kiang. Another sunrise found the
whaler in blue water, running before the monsoon
out across the Eastern Sea.</p>

<p>Though far from a clipper, the <i>Nancy Briggs</i>
was no tub. We sighted Kuro, the westernmost
island of Van Diemen Strait, and its blazing
volcanic neighbor Iwogoshima, on June the second,
eight days over a year and nine months since
the <i>Sea Flight</i> bore me up the superb Bay of
Kagoshima. The interval had been crowded with
events in our physical and mental worlds scarcely
less momentous to myself than to my friend.</p>

<p>But it was no time for me to indulge in retrospection.
I had engaged to navigate the <i>Nancy
Briggs</i> through the narrow waters of an uncharted
strait. The rainy season was well under way, with
all the concomitants of heavy squalls and dense
fogs. As already mentioned, a lucky glimpse of
Kuro, soon confirmed as a landfall by the red
glare of Iwogoshima, enabled me to set our course
to pass through the strait.</p>

<p>We ran in under reefed topsails, feeling our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
way blindly by compass and log in true whaler
fashion. The Yankees took the risk as a matter
of course, but I, between the difficulty of calculating
the effects of the capricious squalls on our
headway and my ignorance of the set of the
powerful currents around this southern extremity
of Japan, found my responsibilities as pilot no
light burden. I was correspondingly relieved
when a rift opened in the smothering masses
of vapor which shrouded all view of sea and land,
and I saw looming up abeam the well-remembered
point of bold Cape Satanomi.</p>

<p>Once clear of the strait, out in the open waters
of the Pacific, we packed on all sail to outdrive
the heavy following sea, and entered upon the
run of over five hundred miles along the southeast
coasts of Kiushiu, Shikoku, and Hondo, the
main island. Though the weather continued wet
and foggy, we were favored by a half gale from
the south and by the drift of the Japan Current,
which here flows little less swiftly than does our
Gulf Stream off Hatteras.</p>

<p>Regardless of the whales which we frequently
sighted, our skipper, true to his agreement, held
on under full sail, night and day, until we made
a landfall of Cape Idzu, the southernmost point
of the great promontory which lies southwest of
Yedo Bay. We could not have desired conditions
more favorable to enable us to approach the coast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
unobserved. Night was coming on and the gale
freshening, but there was no fog. Our skipper
shortened sail, and stood boldly in between the
east coast of Idzu and the chain of islands trending
southward from the mouth of the outer Bay of
Yedo.</p>

<p>Had the gale fallen at sundown, I might have
persuaded the skipper to hold on across and land
us on the west coast of Awa, off the mouth of the
inner bay. Unfortunately the wind moderated
so little and the sky became so overcast that he
ran in under the lee of the great hulking volcano
laid down on the charts as Vries Island, but by
Yoritomo called Oshima.</p>

<p>We were here in the mouth of the outer bay,
and the skipper stated that he was prepared to
fulfil his contract by landing us on the island.
When I protested against being thus marooned,
he declared that he would put us ashore on Vries
Island or nowhere. At this I demanded that
he run up the outer bay and set us adrift in his
gig. He declared that to do so would be sheer
murder, since no boat could outride the billows
in the open bay. However, an offer of half of
Yoritomo’s Japanese gold coins altered his opinion,
and the appearance of the rising moon, which
began to glimmer at intervals through the scurrying
clouds, enabled us to persuade him that
he could run up to within the southern point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Awa and beat out again without endangering his
ship.</p>

<p>The moment he ordered the ship brought
about, Yoritomo and I hastened to prepare
ourselves for the landing by shifting into our
<i>Yamabushi</i>, or mountain-priest robes, which with
other articles of costume we had obtained from the
Japanese at Cha-pu. We had been dressing each
other’s hair in the Japanese fashion and shaving
clean ever since the passage of Van Diemen Strait.
Our dunnage was already lashed together in two
compact bundles, wrapped about with many
thicknesses of waterproof oiled paper.</p>

<p>To the outside of the bundles, I now tied my
revolvers and Yoritomo his sword and dirk, all
alike wrapped in oil paper, together with two
pairs of straw sandals and black leggings and our
deep-brimmed basket hats of coarse-wove rattan.
The night was far too wild for us to risk being
flung into the breakers with any unnecessary
weight about us. That we might not be hampered
by our loose dress, we bound up our long sleeves
to our shoulders and tucked the skirts of the robes
through the back of our girdles.</p>

<p>When we went up on the deck with our dunnage,
a gleam of moonlight showed us the dim, smoking
mass of Vries Island already a full two leagues
astern, while ahead, across eighteen miles or more
of racing foam-crested billows, loomed the mountainous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
coast of Awa. We made our way along
the pitching deck to where the skipper stood
with a group of sailors beside the gig. They
were lashing down a number of empty water
breakers in the bow and stern and under the
thwarts, and there was an oil cask made fast to
the bow with a five-fathom line.</p>

<p>“Ready, hey?” shouted the skipper, when I
made our presence known by touching his arm.
“Well, it’s on your own head, sir. I’m doing
my best for you, as I’m a God-fearing Christian.
But it’ll take a sight of special providence to bear
you safe into haven once you cut adrift.”</p>

<p>I pointed to the oil cask. “A drag?”</p>

<p>“Aye. Keep you from broaching. Best kind
of drag. She’s three-quarters full of oil, and the
head riddled with gimlet holes. The oil will
spread and keep the waves from breaking over
you.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of that whaler’s trick,” I replied,
gripping his broad hand. “And the gig is unsinkable
with those breakers aboard. We’re
bound to win through. I’ll lash our dunnage
in the sternsheets myself.”</p>

<p>The moon went behind a cloud, but one of the
sailors raised the lantern that he was holding
beneath the bulwark and set it within the gig.
Our bundles were soon secured, and we had only
to lean upon the bulwark and gaze over the starboard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
bow towards the dim coast of Awa. Though
under shortened sail, the old <i>Nancy</i> ran before
the gale at so famous a rate that within two hours
the outpeeping moon showed us the furious
surf along the rocky coast, two miles on our
starboard beam.</p>

<p>As agreed, the skipper now put the ship’s
head to the northwest and stood on across the
mouth of the inner bay until we sighted the surf
on the western coast. Our time had come.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI&mdash;<span class="smcap">A Wild Night</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> gig already hung outboard. At
the word from the skipper, Yoritomo
sprang into the sternsheets and I into
the bow, ready to cast off. Six men
stood by to lower away and one to cut
loose our cask drag, which had been swung outboard
in a handy sling.</p>

<p>“Ready, skipper!” I called.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye&mdash;Good luck to you, sir!” he cried,
and wheeling about, he began bawling his orders
to bring the ship about on the port tack.</p>

<p>I had chosen a moment when the moon was
edging out through a cloud rift, so that the deft-handed
Yankees had ample light for their work.
Within half a minute the ship, already running
close aslant the waves, came around into the
trough of the sea. Over she heeled, until she
was all but lying on her beam ends. A little more
and she must have turned turtle. The sea boiled
up alongside until the water poured over the bulwark.
Yet our men stood coolly to their posts.</p>

<p>“Let go the falls!” I shouted, above the howl
of the gale.</p>

<p>The gig splashed into the seething water. In
an instant I had cast loose the bow block.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
“Clear!” cried Yoritomo from the stern.</p>

<p>“Cut!” I yelled.</p>

<p>The oil cask plunged from its severed sling
as the gig swung swiftly down the receding wave
to the leeward of the <i>Nancy</i>. I caught one glimpse
of the gallant old whaler staggering up and swinging
her stem around into the gale. A faint cheer
came ringing down the wind. Then we were
out from under her lee, in the full sweep of the
gale.</p>

<p>Though I had always prided myself upon my
skill in handling small craft, I must confess that
the narrow gig would have swamped or turned
turtle within the first minute had it not been for
our drag and the breaker floats. Before we had
swung around to the drag, a comber broke over
us and filled our little cockleshell to the gunwales.
As she came out of the smother, still afloat but
heavy as a log, we fell to with our bailers like
madmen. We now knew she could not sink, but
without freeboard she would not ride head on
to the cask, and the first wave that caught us
broadside might roll us over.</p>

<p>Fortunately the oil oozing from the cask was
already filming over the surface around us, so
that high as we were flung up by the racing billows
and low as we sagged into their troughs, no more
crests broke upon us. The moment the boat
rode easier, I sprang upon a thwart and gazed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
about for a parting glance of the <i>Nancy Briggs</i>.
But the moon was already covered by a wisp
of the scurrying stormrack. When its silvery
rays again shone upon the wild sea, I fancied
that I caught a glimpse of the whaler standing
out towards the open ocean on the starboard tack.</p>

<p>The deep booming of surf on a rocky shore
brought my gaze about, and as we topped the
next wave I saw that we were abeam the high
cliffs of Cape Sagami, at the western point of
the entrance to the inner bay. I swung aft into
the sternsheets, where Yoritomo crouched ankle-deep
in the wash, still frantically bailing.</p>

<p>“Belay!” I shouted.</p>

<p>He dropped his bailer, and looked over the side
at the surf-whitened shore in blank astonishment.</p>

<p>“So swift!” he cried, “so swift!”</p>

<p>“Wind, wave, and tide,” I rejoined. “I’ve
known a boat to make less speed under sail.
Only trouble, with our present bearings, we’ll
pile up on that outjutting point of the east coast.”</p>

<p>“Before that, Uraga,” he replied.</p>

<p>“According to chart, we’ll drift clear of the
west coast, and there’ll be no guard-boats out of
harbor to-night.”</p>

<p>“But the moonlight; they may sight us,” he
insisted.</p>

<p>“A mile offshore, among these waves! Even
if they had night-glasses, they could not tell the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
gig from a sampan, nor ourselves from storm-driven
fishermen. You say the bay swarms with
fishers.”</p>

<p>“Then there is now only the danger of delay
from being cast up on the east shore.”</p>

<p>“A delay apt to prove permanent if we drift
upon a lee shore in the surf that’s running to-night,”
I added.</p>

<p>“I know you fear death as little as I do,” he
said. “We are brothers in spirit. But that my
message should be delayed or lost&mdash;the gods
forbid!”</p>

<p>“We’re not yet on the rocks, Tomo. We’ve
deep water and to spare for a while,” I cried,
springing up to take our bearings as the moon
was again gliding behind the clouds.</p>

<p>We were now well past Cape Sagami and opposite
a bight whose southern shore, lying under
the lee of its hill-crowned cliffs, was free of all
surf. Leading down through the face of the cliffs
from the terraced hillsides above were many
wooded ravines, at the foot of which villages
nestled upon bits of level ground near the water’s
edge. Here was a haven that might possibly
be gained by casting the drag adrift and rowing
in aslant the wind. But it was below Uraga,
Yedo’s port of entry for the native craft, and
Yoritomo had impressed upon me the great need
to win our way past that nest of government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
inspectors and spies. The attempt to run under
a lee would be no more desperate an undertaking
beyond Uraga than here.</p>

<p>I crouched down again beside my friend, and
waited anxiously for the next glimpse of the moon.
But the weather had suddenly thickened. Gusts
of rain began to dash upon us out of the blackening
sky. The rifts closed up until there was
not even a star visible, and the rain increased
until it poured down aslant the gale in torrents.
The roar of the pelting deluge drowned the boom
of the surf and beat down the wave crests. We
had not even the phosphorescent foam of the
combers to break the inky darkness about us.</p>

<p>The rain was too warm to chill us, but the down-whirling
drops struck upon our bare limbs with
the sting of sleet. We crouched together in the
sternsheets, peering westward into the thick of
the aqueous murk in search for the lights of Uraga.
One glimpse would have given us fair warning to
prepare for my desperate scheme to work under
the lee of the point some two miles beyond.</p>

<p>Death was inevitable should we drive past
that point, across the bend of the bay, to the outjutting
cape on the east shore. Nor was it enough
for us to clear the cape. Even should we escape
destruction there, and even should we drift on
up into the northeast corner of the bay, across
from Yedo, we would no less certainly perish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
in the surf. On the other hand, could I but win
the shelter of the point above Uraga, out of the
full sweep of the in-rolling seas, I might be able
to sheer over to the west shore and gain the shelter
of one of the capes shown on the chart drawn for
me by Yoritomo.</p>

<p>Failing to sight the lights of Uraga, I was in a
pretty pickle. To cut adrift from our drag was
quite sufficiently hazardous without the certainty
that if we put in too soon we should go to wreck
on the Uraga cape, and if we held on too late,
be cast up on the outjutting point of the east
coast. We were utterly lost in the dense night
of whirling wind and rain and swift-heaving
waves. Without means to measure the passage
of time, I could not even reckon our position by
estimating our rate of drift.</p>

<p>“No use watching, Tomo,” I at last shouted.
“We could not see even a lighthouse so thick
a night, and we’ve drifted past by now. Hand
me your dirk.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” he replied, and I felt him turn about
to where his dunnage was lashed down. In a
few minutes he turned back and thrust the hilt
of his short sword into my hand. He asked no
questions, but waited calmly for me to direct
him.</p>

<p>With a few touches of the razor-edged blade I
cut loose the oars, which had been lashed under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
the gunwales. As I pressed the dirk hilt back
into his hand, I gave him his orders: “Go forward
and cut the line when I say; then aft, and stand
by to bail.”</p>

<p>Without a word he crept away towards the bows
through the down-whirling deluge and blackness.
I followed to a seat on the forward thwart, and
waited while three of the great billows flung us
high and dropped us into the trough behind them.
As we sagged down the slope of the third, I dipped
my oar-blades and shouted, “Cut!”</p>

<p>The fourth wave shouldered us skyward. As
we topped the crest the feel of the wind on my
back told me that the gig’s head was falling off
to port. A quick stroke brought her back square
into the wind. We shot down the watery slope, but
before we could climb to another crest Yoritomo
had crept past me to his post in the pointed stern.</p>

<p>With utmost caution I headed the boat a
few points to westward, and began to pull aslant
the waves, with the wind on our port bow. It
was a ticklish moment, for I did not know how the
gig would handle. Without the drag of our abandoned
cask, she might well be expected to fall off
into the trough of the sea.</p>

<p>The struggle was now on in desperate earnest.
But as I bent to my oars with all my skill and
strength, I realized by the way the gig responded
to my efforts that we had at least a fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
chance. Yet it was no easy matter to hold the
bows quarteringly to wind and waves as we shot
up and down the dizzy slopes, and Yoritomo was
kept busy bailing out the water that all too frequently
poured in over the rocking gunwales.</p>

<p>At last, through the howling of the gale and the
slashing roar of the rain on the waters, I heard a
deeper note, the welcome boom of the surf on
the west shore. Whether we were as yet abreast
the cape above Uraga I could not tell, but I held
on as before, regardless of whatever reefs or
shoals might lie off this rocky coast. Soon the
surf roar, which had sounded abreast of us, seemed
to fall away. I gave a shout, and bent to my
oars with redoubled energy. We were drifting
past the point, out into the turn of the bay beyond.</p>

<p>After a quarter-hour or so, to my vast relief
the force of the wind lessened and the waves ran
lower. We were edging around the cape, under
the high lee of the westerly trending shore.
Another quarter-hour, and we were in comparatively
quiet water.</p>

<p>“Tomo,” I called, “shall we attempt a landing?
We can make it with ease under the shelter of
the hills.”</p>

<p>“So near across the point from Uraga?” he
answered. “Could we not coast up the west
shore? Every mile we float nearer to Yedo is
two miles of walking saved.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
“But what if we should fetch up on a lee shore?
You’ve marked more than one promontory on
the west coast.”</p>

<p>“Hold farther out, then,” he said. “By morning
we might drift all the way up the bay and
across the Shinagawa Shoals, into the mouth of
the Sumida River.”</p>

<p>“Clear to Yedo?” I cried. “Yet your chart
makes it less than thirty miles, and it’s only a
question of holding the boat a few points aslant
the wind. We’ve seen how lightly the gig rides.
There’s only the danger of those promontories,
and I’ve the wind to steer by. We’ll do it,
Tomo!”</p>

<p>“Commodore Perry may already be at Nagasaki,”
he added, by way of final argument for
haste.</p>

<p>“Give me your robe,” I said.</p>

<p>He slipped off the loose garment without demur,
and crept forward to press it into my hand. We
were now in water in which the boat could be
safely allowed to drift without guidance. I flung
the oars inboard and lashed the robe to one of
them so as to make a small triangular sail. While
I worked I gave Yoritomo his instructions. Soon
the sail was ready. I handed it over to my friend,
and with the second oar for rudder made my way
aft to the sharp stern. A few strokes brought
us around with the wind on our port quarter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Immediately Yoritomo stepped his oar mast
through the socket in the forward thwart, and
set sail.</p>

<p>Though so small, the little cotton triangle drew
well, as I could tell by the ease with which the
gig responded to her helm. Another proof was
the quickness with which we ran out from under
our sheltering highland into the full sweep of the
gale and the high waves of the open bay. Scudding
aslant the wind as nearly north as I could
reckon our bearings from the drive of the rain
torrents, we hurled along through the black night,
utterly lost to all sense of time and distance.</p>

<p>After what may have been two hours, or possibly
three, the rain slackened to a fine drizzle and the
wind began to lull, blowing in fitful gusts and veering
about in a way that left me only the run of
the waves by which to shape my course. Soon
after, to my surprise, the great rollers began to
lessen in height, clear proof that we had come
under the lee of a headland. Outwearied by the
long struggle, I decided to try for the shelter
which it seemed to offer. But before I could
give the order to Yoritomo to shift sail, a roller
broke aboard us, filling the gig to the gunwales.</p>

<p>“Unship and bail!” I yelled.</p>

<p>“Bailer gone!” he shouted, and he crawled
aft with his robe sail wrapped about the oar.</p>

<p>A second roller broke over us. We were among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
breakers, either upon a bank or a shoaling beach.
As I labored to hold the gig stern on to the waves,
I cried out in anticipation of the coming shock:
“Hold to your oar! Cut loose the bundles.
Stand by to pass me mine.”</p>

<p>“Ready!” he called back.</p>

<p>The gig struck softly on a mud bottom, and
was instantly smothered under a third breaker.
But the impact drove her over the bank, and we
found ourselves afloat in fairly calm water. An
attempt to pole with my oar showed me that we
were in water deeper than I could sound. A
last puff of the expiring gale caught the boat and
swung her about broadsides. Before I could
bring her bows on again she struck bottom on
another mud bank.</p>

<p>Through the lessening drizzle I could see the
outline of a rising shore near at hand. The boat
lifted in the low swell that rolled over the outer
shoal, drove forward a few yards, and stuck fast.
A downward thrust of my oar told me there was
hard bottom a foot below the ooze.</p>

<p>“My bundle, and follow!” I cried.</p>

<p>Yoritomo thrust my dunnage into my hands,
and leaped overboard after me. Ten yards through
knee-deep mud and water brought us to the foot
of a sloping embankment. We climbed up it
and stretched out upon its turf-covered crest,
panting with the fatigue of our long battle against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
wind and wave, yet aglow with delight at our
victory.</p>

<p>“Come,” said Yoritomo, after a short rest.
“The rain has ceased. I will put on my robe and
lead you to an inn or farmhouse.”</p>

<p>“Wait,” I replied. “The dawn must be near.
We cannot leave the gig to be found by the
first man who comes this way. We must sink
her.”</p>

<p>Lightened of our weight, the gig had cleared
and drifted in almost to the foot of the embankment.
By rolling we sluiced enough water from
her to set her afloat, and I set about knocking
out the bungs of the breakers, while Yoritomo
fetched heavy lumps of turf and clay from a break
in the face of the embankment. As the boat
sank deeper into the water with the filling of the
breakers and the weight of the clay ballast, we
thrust off into deeper water. At last I was
satisfied, and shoving her out into the channel
between the mud banks, I rocked under the gunwales
until she filled and sank.</p>

<p>A few strokes brought me back into shallow
water, and I soon regained the embankment. In
the faintly gathering light I saw that Yoritomo
had already put on not only his robe but also his
leggings and sandals. He thrust my hat and
revolvers into my hands and knelt to bind on my
sandals and leggings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
“The clouds break,” he exclaimed. “It is a
good omen. Let us hasten on.”</p>

<p>“On?” I said. “We cannot go far without
rest.”</p>

<p>“Until we find a farmhouse or inn,” he urged.
Springing up, he swung his dunnage upon his
shoulder and led off inland.</p>

<p>A few steps brought us down the far side of the
embankment into a shallow swamp. As we
splashed through the oozy slush I felt tufts of
soft grassy stems brushing against my ankles at
regular intervals.</p>

<p>“Rice field,” muttered my friend before I
could question him.</p>

<p>The stench of the strongly fertilized paddy
swamp was almost insufferable, and our discomfort
was not lessened by the maddening swarms
of mosquitoes. We crossed a narrow dyke and
splashed along with quickened step through a
second field worse than the first. Still another
dyke, and then, beyond the third field, we sighted
higher ground, above which loomed the dimly
outlined tops of gigantic trees.</p>

<p>“The Tokaido!” cried Yoritomo.</p>

<p>A hundred yards across the last fetid swamp
brought us up the bank and into a broad smooth
road beneath the dense gloom of a double row
of cryptomerias. We were upon the famed
Tokaido, or East Sea Road, which connects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Yedo with Kyoto and the southwestern provinces
of Japan. To my surprise, Yoritomo crossed
over, instead of turning along the road. As I
followed, he pointed to a wooded hill, upon which
a group of lofty trees and the black mass of a small
peak-roofed building stood out against the brightening
sky.</p>

<p>Skirting the edge of the Tokaido, we soon came
to a path that led us windingly around through
high coppices and up the far slope of the hill.
The last of the clouds were now sweeping away to
the northward, and the eastern sky was gray with
the pallor of the false dawn. We gained the round
of the hill, and passed between a pair of heavy
wooden pillars, cross-tied with a square lintel-beam
and a massive roof-beam, or framework,
with upcurving ends.</p>

<p>“A <i>torii</i>,” muttered Yoritomo. “We come
to a temple, not an inn.”</p>

<p>Though I caught a hint of disappointment
in his tone, he led on up the bend of the hillcrest
and across a shrubbery, to the front of the small
grass-thatched building in the midst of the towering
pines.</p>

<p>“It is a <i>miya</i>&mdash;a Shinto temple,” he murmured.
“Yet we need food as well as rest.”</p>

<p>“They will give us no food, when we come as
fellow-priests?” I exclaimed in mock indignation.</p>

<p>“Even when a <i>miya</i> is not deserted, the priests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
of Shinto seldom dwell in or near it,” he replied,
and I heard him sigh. He was as near outspent
as myself. But suddenly I saw his bent form
straighten. He faced about to the western sky,
with upraised arms, and his voice rang clear and
strong in a salute of reverent joy: “<i>Fuji-yama!
Fuji-san!</i>”</p>

<p>I turned to look. Far away to the west-southwest,
beyond the black silhouette of broken
mountain ranges and lesser peaks, a marvellous
pyramid of rosy flame towered high aloft in the
starry sky. Red dawn, as yet unseen by us,
had turned the snow-clad crest of the superb
peak into the likeness of a gigantic blossom,
pendent from mid-sky.</p>

<p>“<i>Fuji-san!</i>” repeated Yoritomo, and he fell
upon his knees and bowed his forehead to the
ground, overcome with rapture.</p>

<p>Swiftly the roseate effulgence brightened and
shifted hue to a glorious gold that shone with
dazzling brightness against the blue-black sky.
The eastern sky was now flaming high with the red
dawn. Lighter shone the great peak-crest, its
gold changing under the magic transmutation of
day into the cold, burnished silver of its glistening
snows. The sun leaped above the horizon, and
the last shadow of night fled.</p>

<p>Yoritomo rose from his knees and caught up
his bundle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
“Come within,” he said. “We can at least
rest, and it is well we should not be seen until we
have arranged our dress.”</p>

<p>Caught in the midst of a yawn, I signed assent,
and he led me past the stone image of a sitting
fox to the narrow entrance of the temple. Pushing
in after him with my bundle, I found myself in
a gloomy chamber, shut off from the rear half of
the temple by a close wall. There was no idol
to be seen, and the only furnishing of the bare
little room was a small mirror of polished bronze
hung about with strips of white paper.</p>

<p>Yoritomo kowtowed before this curious symbol
of Shinto, rose to his knees, and waved me to lie
down. I stretched out, yawning, and he sank
down beside me. In another minute we were
both fast asleep.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII&mdash;<span class="smcap">On the Tokaido</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">We</span> wakened, stiff and sore, a full
two hours after noon. Yoritomo,
who was first to rouse up, ran to
the door to look out. He turned
about, with an urgent cry that
cut short my yawnings in the midst: “Up! up,
brother! We’ve slept past midday. We must
lose no time if we expect to reach the heart of
Yedo by nightfall.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember the two biscuits I wrapped
in my bundle?” I demanded. “I’m famished.
A drink and a biscuit for me before I take to any
road race.”</p>

<p>“We must dress and eat. There is water
outside,” he responded, and he slashed open our
bundles.</p>

<p>Not a drop of water had penetrated the oil-paper
wrappings. We slipped off our stained and
tattered Yamabushi robes to put on the silken
garments which he had carried from his country
all the long voyage to Europe and back. First
came a pair each of the gorgeous baggy trousers,
or <i>hakama</i>. They were provided with side slits,
into which we tucked the skirts of our silk <i>kimonos</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
The narrow twisted <i>obi</i>, or sash, served to hold
my revolvers and the magnificent Masamune
sword presented to me by Yoritomo that eventful
night in the cabin of the <i>Sea Flight</i>.</p>

<p>My friend thrust his sword and dirk into his
girdle, not in the horizontal Japanese fashion,
but vertically, as I wore mine, that the scabbards
might not show beneath our outer robes. His
writing case and the bag containing his smoker’s
outfit were secured on the other side by passing
the carved ivory buttons of their cords through
a fold of the girdle. Inside, about my waist,
I placed my twenty odd pounds of metallic revolver
cartridges, while he packed within his bosom a
lighter though bulkier load consisting of white
silk foot-mittens, extra sandals, a roll of crinkly
writing paper, and the box with the remainder
of his gold coins.</p>

<p>Over all we drew our cloak-like coats, or <i>haoris</i>,
of rich stiff silk, upon which the circled mallow-leaf
trefoil of the Tokugawa crest was embroidered
on back, breasts, and sleeves. These coats were
in turn covered with our dingy priest robes, and
we were outwardly prepared to take the road.
There remained our inward preparation. We
took our ship’s biscuits and passed out the narrow
entrance.</p>

<p>My first glance was directed towards Fujiyama.
But the glorious peak was shrouded from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
view by a bank of envious clouds. Yoritomo
turned at once to a hollowed stone from which
trickled a rill of pure water. We drank and
crouched down beside the spring to gnaw at our
biscuits. At first I was too hungry to heed my
surroundings. Yoritomo, however, soon pointed
southward, through a gap in the shrubbery, to
where, some four miles distant, a hilly promontory
jutted out into the bay.</p>

<p>“That is the town of Kanagawa,” he said.</p>

<p>“Where?” I asked. “I see no smoke. Do
you mean that little gray blotch low down on the
edge of the promontory?”</p>

<p>“No, that is only a small fishing village lying
among the rice swamps,&mdash;Yokohama, I believe,
is its name. Kanagawa lies about two miles to
the west of it. You see no smoke because in
Japan we use charcoal only. Kanagawa is the
last station on the Tokaido where the <i>daimios</i>
stop over night before marching into Yedo.”</p>

<p>“But the sons of the <i>daimios</i> repose amidst the
splendors of the temples,” I bantered him.</p>

<p>He glanced about reverently at the decaying
little edifice. “The spirit of Shinto is simplicity.
Yet I wish I could have entertained you with
proper hospitality, and that we might enter Yedo
in the manner to which we are entitled by our
rank.”</p>

<p>“Ours?” I questioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
“Are we not brothers?” he countered.</p>

<p>“You know the position of my family at home,”
I said. “But it is a far cry from America to
Dai Nippon. I have read what the Dutch writers
tell about the hauteur of your nobility. Even
as a friend of a kinsman of your Emperor, will
I be received?”</p>

<p>“I am not the kinsman of the Emperor,” he
replied.</p>

<p>“You’re not? Yet you said that your father,
the Prince of Owari&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He and the princes of Kii and Mito are the
heads of the August Three Families, descendent
from the three sons of Iyeyasu. He is the cousin
of the Shogun, not of the Emperor. One alone
can be called Emperor of Nippon. That is the
Dairi&mdash;the Mikado, lineal descendant of Ama-terasu,
the Sun Goddess. The sacred Son of
Heaven lives in awesome seclusion at Kyoto.”</p>

<p>“Yet I am aware that your shoguns, whom the
outer world has known as the temporal emperors,
have ruled Nippon with mailed fist since the days
of my ancestor, the English counsellor of Iyeyasu.”</p>

<p>He stared at me in blank astonishment. “The
English counsellor of Iyeyasu!&mdash;he your ancestor?&mdash;Anjin
Sama your ancestor?”</p>

<p>“Will Adams, the first Englishman to reach
Japan,” I answered. “Surely you have heard
of him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
“Adams! Was that the English name of Anjin
Sama?&mdash;and he your ancestor? You never told
me!”</p>

<p>“How much have you told me of your family,
Tomo?”</p>

<p>“But Anjin Sama, of all the <i>kami</i>&mdash;!” He
gazed at me with a strange glow in his black
eyes. “You know our belief, Worth, that the
dead come back many times and are often born
again.”</p>

<p>“The Buddhistic reincarnation,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“And the Shinto rebirth of the <i>kami</i>&mdash;the
high ones,” he added.</p>

<p>“But what of Will Adams?” I demanded, aflame
with curiosity. “I know that he married a Japanese
wife and left children by her. Have they
any living descendants?”</p>

<p>He looked away, with an enigmatic smile.</p>

<p>“You may learn more of your ancestor, brother,
after we reach Yedo. There is an Anjin Street,
whose householders still hold a yearly festival in
his memory.&mdash;Come; it is time for us to be
going.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he rose and started around the
corner of the temple. I followed him to the
corner and back along the side of the decaying
building, below the ragged thatch of the eaves.
At the rear corner we came to a narrow gap in
the shrubbery looking down upon the Tokaido.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Yoritomo suddenly turned about, with his fingers
to his lips, and drew me down.</p>

<p>“Kwannon be praised!” he whispered. “They
did not see us! For common beggar-priests to
be caught staring down upon a <i>daimio’s</i> train&mdash;<i>Namu!</i>”</p>

<p>I peered forward and down into the Tokaido,
which ran past less than a hundred yards below
us. Along the broad roadway was marching the
most curious and stately procession I had ever seen.
It was the retinue of a <i>daimio</i> who was going up
to Yedo for the half-year’s visit required by law.
By far the greater part of the procession was
already strung out Yedo-ward farther than the
eye could see. But half a thousand of the rearguard
had yet to pass.</p>

<p>Used as I was to the sight of Yoritomo’s garments,
there was much to surprise and interest
me in the appearance of the <i>daimio’s</i> retainers.
Though as short as our women, they were of a
more stalwart build than I had expected, and
the <i>samurais</i>, or two-sword men, carried themselves
with a proud assurance that went far
towards offsetting their lack of height. Among
the loose ranks of these gentlemanly men-at-arms
marched lesser retainers,&mdash;grooms with grotesquely
accoutred led-horses and porters with
rattan baskets and lacquered chests.</p>

<p>Yoritomo whispered that the box-like palanquin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
or <i>norimon</i>, of the <i>daimio</i> had long since been
carried past by its bearers. Yet this rear end of
the procession marched slowly along with a
demeanor that could not have been exceeded in
solemnity and stateliness had the <i>daimio</i> been
present in its midst. The hush was almost oppressive.
No man among them called out or spoke
or even whispered. The only sounds were the
scuffle of sandals in the dusty road and the muffled
thud of straw-shod horse hoofs.</p>

<p>“What is the crest?” I whispered, staring
at the insignia embroidered on the outer garments
of every retainer and marked on every piece of
baggage. “It looks like a white cross in a circle.”</p>

<p>“A circled cross,” confirmed Yoritomo. “You
saw it in Kagoshima Bay,&mdash;the crest of my
friend Nariakiri, Daimio of Satsuma.”</p>

<p>“The Prince of Satsuma!” I exclaimed. “Why
not hasten down and join him?”</p>

<p>“Hasten down, and be slashed or beheaded
by the first <i>samurai</i> we passed!” rejoined Yoritomo,
grasping my sleeve as I sought to spring up.
“Even without these tattered robes it would mean
certain death. Each <i>daimio</i> is appointed a time
for passing along the highroad. Any one who
breaks in upon the procession may expect to die
without benefit of medicine.”</p>

<p>“But he is your friend, and if you are so anxious
to reach home by nightfall&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
“There are no by-ways through the rice
swamps,” he replied. “We must trail after the
rearguard.”</p>

<p>“They move at a snail’s pace!”</p>

<p>“It will bring them into Shinagawa, the southern
suburb of Yedo, about sunset. In Shinagawa
I expect to find a friend with whom we can spend
the night. Meantime we may as well wait here
until the cortege has gone on four or five miles.
I will take advantage of the opportunity to write
a petition asking permission to present a memorial
to the Shogun.”</p>

<p>He crept back around the corner of the temple.
I stretched out in the balsamic shade of the pines,
and watched the slow passing of the procession.
When the last strutting <i>samurai</i> had marched on
up the road, I gazed around at the landscape.
Across the full width of the bay the mountains
on the promontory of Awa loomed dimly through
the haze, while the blue waters between, already
stilled from their night’s turmoil, were dotted
with the white sails of junks and fishing smacks.</p>

<p>Inland the golden sunlight streamed down out
of the sapphire sky upon a scene no less peaceful
and charming. About me and far to the northward
the land lay in broad plain, for the most part cut
up into a checkerboard of rice fields. Here and
there rose knolls and hills, some terraced to the
top for rice, others wooded, and the most eminent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
crowned with temples that reminded me of China.
In the rice swamps naked peasants, knee-deep
in the slush, were transplanting tufts of young
rice, while about them waterfowl waded or
paddled, untroubled by the presence of man.
Above them soared numbers of eagles and hawks.
Birds were to be seen or heard on every side,
but I noticed a marked absence of animals from the
landscape.</p>

<p>Some time after the rear of the procession had
disappeared up the Tokaido, Yoritomo came
back around the temple, and said that we must
start. I pulled my hat brim low over my face,
and swung after him down the hillside to the
smooth road.</p>

<p>For a time we met no other traveller. The
road had been swept clear by the procession.
But we soon came to groups of odd little shops and
inns, strung along the roadside in almost continuous
rows. Within the open fronts of the shops
cotton-robed tradesmen knelt on matted platforms
in the midst of their cheap wares, while
from under the shallow porticos of the inns
quaint little maidens with powdered doll-like
faces and narrow skirts smiled at us invitingly
and bowed until we could see the great bows at
the back of their sashes. But Yoritomo kept on
up the road at a fast pace, unmoved by the alluring
glances of these charming little waitresses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
Within the second mile we began to encounter
a stream of travellers released from the post town
of Kawasaki by the passage of the <i>daimio’s</i> train.
We were the first to come up from the south in
the wake of the <i>daimio</i>, but the people we met had
no more than a casual glance for a pair of dirty-robed
Yamabushi priests.</p>

<p>As we swung along through their midst I peeped
out at them between the meshes of my loosely
woven hat brim. My first observations were that
they averaged far below the height of Americans,
and that clothing was rather a minus quantity
among all but the white-robed pilgrims and the
silk-clad <i>samurais</i>. The brown skins of peasants
and fishermen, porters, grooms, and beggars were
either innocent of all covering except narrow
loincloths or at most limited to a shirt-like <i>kimono</i>
of blue-figured cotton, a straw hat, and sandals.</p>

<p>Aside from the aristocratic swordsmen, these
people were the merriest I had ever met. When
not smiling and chatting, they were laughing
or singing. Among the peasants and groups of
pilgrims were several women, the younger of
whom possessed a buxom rural prettiness. The
married women looked aged and withered, and
pleasant as were their smiles, my Western eye
was repulsed by their shaven brows and the
gray-black teeth which showed between their
rouged lips at every smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
At Kawasaki we swung briskly down to the bank
of the Rokugu River, where bronzed ferrymen,
stripped to loincloths, stood waiting for passengers
in their big flat-bottomed punts. A boat in which
the party of a <i>samurai</i> horseman had embarked
was being thrust off. Before Yoritomo could
check me, I sprang forward to leap aboard. In
a flash the <i>samurai</i> drew his two-handed sword
and aimed a blow at me that would have split
my head in two had I not dropped backwards
beyond reach. Furious at the wanton attempt
to murder me, I sprang up and fumbled for a
revolver as the boat shot out from the bank.</p>

<p>“Hold, brother!” warned Yoritomo, springing
to catch my arm. “Remember, we are only
begging priests. He had the right to resent our
company. What’s more, he is a <i>hatamoto</i>, one
of the Shogun’s <i>samurais</i>. If I remember aright,
he is Yuki, a captain of the palace guard.”</p>

<p>“He tried to cut me down in cold blood!” I
protested.</p>

<p>“It is a right of all <i>samurais</i> to kill lower-class
men, and you affronted Yuki by seeking to board
the same boat. Here’s a smaller boat putting
off.”</p>

<p>We ran and leaped aboard the small boat as
it swung into the stream. For fellow-passengers
we had a wealthy old merchant, dressed in plain
cotton robes, and the half-naked bearers of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
narrow U-shaped basket-litter. In paying our
ferry fees, Yoritomo offered one of his gold pieces,
and the boat’s owner being unable to make full
change, he gave him the difference. As a result
the polers bent to their work with such hearty
good-will that we reached the opposite bank a
full three lengths in advance of the <i>samurai’s</i>
boat.</p>

<p>We sprang ashore past a bevy of little brown
children who were paddling, stark naked, in the
mud. Shortly beyond we met a pair of neatly
dressed girls, whose large mushroom hats rested
upon black silk skullcaps. They smiled and
greeted us in a familiar manner. Yoritomo
muttered a hasty response, and pointed back at
the <i>samurai</i>. The girls hastened to advance
upon that quick-tempered gentleman, with their
battery of charming smiles and alluring glances
in full action.</p>

<p>“Courtesans?” I asked, as we swung on along
the Tokaido.</p>

<p>“No, not <i>joros</i>, only <i>bikunis</i>&mdash;begging nuns,
daughters of Yamabushi priests. None would
be quicker to penetrate our disguise,” replied
Yoritomo, and he quickened his pace.</p>

<p>After a mile or so we again met a crowd of southbound
travellers, people caught at Omuri by the
closing of the highroad. We hastened on to
Omuri, the first post village out of Shinagawa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
Recently as the <i>daimio’s</i> procession had passed,
the place was already alert for business, its shops
wide open and teahouse girls standing coy-eyed
in the verandas. We hastened on through, pausing
only to buy some large dried persimmons that
caught my eye.</p>

<p>A mile behind the town we came up with the
rear of the Satsuma procession, and were compelled
by prudence to slacken our pace to a tortoise-like
gait. Making the best of the situation, I
relished my persimmons and viewed the scenery.
There was much novelty and pleasure in the sight
of orange trees and bamboos and even an occasional
banana and palm growing in the same garden
with pines and other evergreens, while the deep-thatched
roofs of the farmhouses were oddly
attractive with the beds of blue irises and vivid
red lilies blooming on their flattened ridges.</p>

<p>Above us towered the giant red-limbed cryptomerias
of the Tokaido, with their pine-like
foliage, while on our right the road skirted along
near the sparkling blue waters of the bay, upon
which sailed flotillas of quaint fishing craft and
high-sterned junks that might have served as
models for a painter of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Yoritomo touched my arm and pointed to something
lying on the opposite side of the road. I
looked closer, and saw that it was the corpse of
a peasant, mangled by terrible sword cuts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
“A drunken fool,” he said, unmoved by the
horrible sight. “No sober man would have been
found in the road after it had been sanded for the
passage of a <i>daimio</i>.”</p>

<p>Before I could reply, a little bell tinkled in the
road behind us, and Yoritomo drew me quickly
out of the middle of the thoroughfare. I glanced
about and saw two runners racing towards us
at headlong speed. One carried the little bell
I had heard, the other bore a small bundle on a
stick, across his shoulder. Both were stripped to
their loincloths, though at first glance I thought
that they were clad in tights, so completely were
they covered with animal designs tattooed in
red, blue, and white.</p>

<p>In a moment the couriers had dashed past
us and were flying on, regardless of the stately
cortege that barred the road. With the murdered
peasant fresh in mind, I looked to see the Satsuma
men turn about with sword and lance to avenge
this outrage upon the dignity of their lord. To
my vast astonishment, the solemn ranks split
apart all along the centre of the road at the first
tinkle of the little bell, and the naked runners
raced on without a check through the midst of
the procession.</p>

<p>“Carriers of despatches for the Shogun,” explained
Yoritomo in response to my look of
amazed inquiry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Here was food for thought to last me into Shinagawa,
slow as was our pace. Nowhere in the world
had I witnessed such solemn state as was exhibited
by this <i>daimio</i> cortege, a state so exalted that
men were killed for venturing within sword-sweep
of the procession’s vanguard. Yet at the tinkle
of a bell, all had yielded the road to a pair of naked,
sweaty, unarmed postmen. What, then, must be
the sublimity of rank and state arrogated to himself
by the master of this prince? Yet the father
of the quiet, mild-mannered gentleman trudging
along in the dust beside me was the blood kinsman
of that Oriental lord of lords.</p>

<p>We were close upon Shinagawa before I realized
that the sun was far down the western sky and fast
sinking behind a bank of black clouds. As I
looked up my eye fell upon a rude pillory, standing
near the roadside on ground raised above the
level of the rice swamp. Along the top of the rude
structure sat five roundish objects sharply outlined
against the blood-red sky. Looking closer,
I made out ghastly human faces&mdash;a crow flapped
up from the ground, with a hoarse cry, and began
pecking at one of the severed heads.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Geisha</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">Day</span> was fading into twilight as we
trailed after the Satsuma men into
the heart of Shinagawa. On either
side of the Tokaido extended rows
of handsome two-storied inns and
teahouses, set one against the other without a
gap except where divided by narrow cross streets.
The upper windows and balconies of every building
were sealed over with opaque screens to prevent
persons from looking down upon the <i>daimio</i> and
his retinue, and across the entrances of the side
streets were stretched frail ropes of twisted straw,
behind which kneeling crowds waited for the
passage of the last Satsuma man.</p>

<p>The street was guarded by wardsmen, or
householders, bearing iron staves with large rings
at the top. We shuffled along between these
warders, with downbent heads, perilously close
to the rear of the procession. Three or four times
the wardsmen seemed inclined to halt us, but we
passed by them with outward indifference, keeping
well in advance of the crowds that surged out
behind us into the Tokaido from the unbarred
side streets.</p>

<p>Midway of the long suburb Yoritomo turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
sharply into a narrow street leading towards the
bay. I stooped under the barring rope after
him, and found myself in the midst of a dense
crowd of men, many of whom were still kneeling.
Packed side by side in the jam were cotton-clad
tradesmen and silk-gowned <i>samurais</i>, half-naked
artisans and nobles in lacquered <i>norimon</i> palanquins.
All alike were provided with paper lanterns,
round, square, or octagonal in shape, and inscribed
with crest or name in Chinese ideographs. These
lanterns and the rows of similar ones hung along
the fronts of the houses were being lighted as
twilight deepened into darkness.</p>

<p>Suddenly the crowd through which we were
attempting to pass swayed forward and filled the
air with the clash of their wooden clogs on the
hard ground. The rope had been taken down
and the crowd permitted to surge out into the
Tokaido. While we worked our way in against
the outpouring stream, I was pleased to see that
there were no women in the jam. But on either
side of the street wide-flung screens exposed to
view artistically decorated interiors where smiling
young girls in gorgeous dress knelt on the mats,
twanging odd music on their three-string <i>samisens</i>
or preening themselves before mirrors of polished
bronze. In other houses dainty waiting maids
fluttered about like butterflies, serving the hungry
guests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
The crowd in the street was the sweetest one
with which I had ever come in contact, and this
was no less true when we elbowed our way through
a band of breech-clouted porters. The explanation
was not far off when, with the breaking of the jam,
we approached a building through whose latticed
front issued clouds of vapor and a babel of chatter
and laughter.</p>

<p>When opposite this house I glanced in through
the wide spaces of the lattice and was startled
to see a large company of nude men and women
splashing about together in a great tank of hot
water. It was a public bath&mdash;public in all
senses of the term! As we passed by, a dripping
nymph stepped up from the water within a foot of
the lattice and gazed idly out into the street, as
naively unconscious in look and manner and as
innocent of costume as Eve before the Fall.</p>

<p>Yoritomo swung by unheeding, and hastened
on to the open front of one of the larger teahouses.
A moment later we had entered a long stone-paved
passageway that ran back through the centre
of the building. On one side we looked in upon the
charcoal ranges and sniffed the savory odors of
the inn kitchen, on the other we viewed through
half-closed screens the commoner guest-rooms of
the house.</p>

<p>At sight of our tattered robes bowing waitresses
sought to usher us into one of these front apartments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
Yoritomo thrust past them and on down the
passage, fifty paces or more, until we came out
into a veritable fairy garden, strung with myriads
of painted lanterns. As we seated ourselves on a
low bench under a grape arbor, the host overtook
us and, bowing curtly, asked what we desired.</p>

<p>“Does Kohana, the free <i>geisha</i>, still live here?”
asked Yoritomo.</p>

<p>“Kohana San, the artist patronized by princes,
still honors my poor establishment,” replied the
man.</p>

<p>“We would speak with her,” said Yoritomo,
pushing back his hat until his pale aristocratic
face could be seen in the soft lantern light.</p>

<p>The landlord, who had been about to turn us
off, hesitated and answered in a more respectful
tone: “The most famous dancer of Yedo enjoys
the favor of <i>daimios</i>. How then can I bid her
come to attend those who seem no more than
Yamabushi?”</p>

<p>Yoritomo drew a sheet of paper from his bosom,
and taking his brush pen from the case at his
girdle, wrote a few small ideographs in the classical
Chinese character. Swift as were his strokes, the
first letter was scarcely drawn before the host
was kowtowing, forehead to earth. He rose,
touched the finished writing to his brow, and
clattered off on his high wooden clogs across the
fairyland of his garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
“You have declared yourself!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“To him, no. My manner of writing convinced
him that I am of high rank. But I wrote only a
quotation from one of the ancient poems. Even
if he is learned enough to read it&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Will this dancer then grasp your meaning?”</p>

<p>“Kohana is one of the higher class of <i>geisha</i>
called <i>shirabyoshi</i>,&mdash;one of the superior artists.
She is of <i>samurai</i> blood, and the old <i>geisha</i> who
bought her in childhood, and trained her after
the manner of <i>geishas</i>, gave her the highest of
women’s culture. Before I left Yedo I bought the
girl’s freedom from service. She was then in
her eighteenth year.”</p>

<p>“You bought her freedom!” I murmured.
“You who look so coldly upon women!”</p>

<p>“I could do no more for her,&mdash;and no less.
We loved, but love cannot bind a true <i>samurai</i>
when duty calls. I vowed to give my life to the
service of the Mikado and Dai Nippon. To have
lingered with her after that would have been
despicable.”</p>

<p>I sat silent, reflecting upon the strange customs
of this queer people and the hidden depths in
the nature of my friend. All my intimacy with
him, backed by close study of Kämpfer and
Siebold, had failed to prepare me for the bizarre
contrasts and impressions of the mysterious land
of Nippon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
In the garden about us pleasure-seekers strolled
along the rough-paved walks on lacquered clogs,
but none disturbed our seclusion in the arbor
until the landlord came shuffling back. He kowtowed
before us, with loud insuckings of his
breath. I could scarcely hear his murmured
words: “Kohana San sends humble greetings
to the honorable writer, and entreats him and his
honorable companion to honor her lowly dwelling
with their august presence.”</p>

<p>“We need no guide,” replied Yoritomo, as the
landlord rose to conduct us.</p>

<p>The man again prostrated himself and held
to the obsequious salute until we had moved away.
The moon gave no light through the curtain of
drifting cloud, but as we hastened along a winding
path, in through the gay rows of swaying paper
lanterns, I made out amidst the graceful trees
and flowering shrubs grotesque bronze figures,
odd shaped rocks, and quaint pagoda-topped
stone lanterns.</p>

<p>Soon the path led down along the shore of
a tiny lake, whose still surface glinted with the
many-hued reflections of the lanterns. We crossed
over at one corner on a frail bamboo bridge,
arched like a quarter-round of hoop, and passed
through a fern-set rockery, to a gateless opening
in a hedge of bamboos. Beside this entrance,
resplendent in a miniature <i>kimono</i> of silver-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>wrought
blue silk, waited a doll-like little maiden of
twelve, who, having duly kowtowed to us, tottered
ahead on her high clogs, to conduct us to the house
of her mistress.</p>

<p>A few steps brought us to a rambling red-tiled
bungalow with broad, low eaves and deep-set
verandas. Mounting daintily before us up the
rough stone steps, the child knelt upon the polished
planking of the veranda, to remove our sandals.
If she was astonished at our mudstained leggings,
she showed not the slightest sign, but bowed us
into the house with winsome smiles.</p>

<p>Though all the screens were open, the interior
before us was dark as midnight. The little
maiden reached down one of the lanterns that
hung from the eaves among the tinkling wind-bells,
and lighted us in across two tiny rooms to
a large apartment fronting on a miniature garden
court. All one side of the room was open to the
court veranda, and two of the other walls were
formed of sliding screens, but the far end of the
room was closed with a solid partition containing
a shallow double alcove.</p>

<p>The little maid hastened to place two soft
leather cushions for us, hesitating just perceptibly
over the second until Yoritomo indicated that
it was to be laid beside the first, close before the
raised floor of the larger recess. Having kowtowed
while we reposed ourselves on knees and heels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
she pattered about the room with a taper, lighting
the pith wicks of several little saucer lamps that
were set about the room in square paper frames.</p>

<p>I glanced around the apartment in the increasing
glow. The soft, thick mats, all about three
by six feet in size, were set in the floor on a level
with the slotted sill-beams of the wall-screens.
Unlike those I had seen in the front rooms of the
inns, they were not only immaculately white and
clean but were bordered with strips of silk. The
sliding screens of the room were rimmed with
gold leaf and painted with exquisite landscapes
in rich soft colors. The low ceiling and the recessed
wall behind us were finished in fanciful cabinetwork,
and the beautiful grain of the two woods
used was polished without oil or varnish to a
surface that shone like satin.</p>

<p>The one side of the recess was an open closet,
filled with shelves and drawers; the other was the
sacred <i>tokonoma</i> mentioned by the Dutch writers.
Upon its wall hung a blue silk banner, painted with
a summer view of Fuji-yama. Below, on the
polished floor, a vase of plain earthenware held
a single fragrant spray of Cape jasmine. Across
from the vase stood the bronze figure of a playful
kitten, with paw outstretched in graceful invitation.
Before it were placed a few grains of boiled
rice, a tiny cup of amber liquid, and a stick of
burning incense. It was the emblem and godlet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
of the <i>geishas</i>,&mdash;a frolicsome young cat, behind
whose velvet touch lurked cruel claws, ever ready
to mangle.</p>

<p>Would the worshipper of this image meet her
former lover with feline treachery?</p>

<p>As I asked myself the question the room re-echoed
with a ripple of gentle laughter, melodious
as the note of an Æolian harp, sweeter than the
tinkle of fairy bells. I faced to front, and saw
floating towards us a vision as wondrously beautiful
as a Buddhist angel. Against the jet blackness
of her high coiffure glinted comb crests and pin
heads of amber and coral, while from slender
throat to tiny feet she was enveloped in a robe
of scarlet silk, gorgeously embroidered with
flowers in gold thread, and her plump little hand
fluttered a vividly colored fan.</p>

<p>Like my friend’s, the girl’s face showed the
<i>samurai</i> type in its oval contour, small mouth,
and aristocratic nose,&mdash;features so markedly
different from the broad, flat faces of the lower
classes. The characteristic lack of prominence
of her brows and the bridge of her nose lent to
the upper part of her face a mildness of expression
well in keeping with the inimitable gracefulness
and gentleness of her bearing, but her rosebud
mouth and lustrous black eyes held all the subtle
allurement of a Spanish Carmen’s.</p>

<p>Bound about as she is by narrow skirts, modesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
compels the Japanese woman to assume in walking
a short, scuffling, intoed gait, with forward bent
body and head. Yet even to this awkward movement
Kohana San, the dancer, contrived to give
a semblance of grace as she hastened forward to
prostrate herself at the feet of my friend.</p>

<p>The little maid was tripping from the room.
The <i>geisha</i> sank down before us, her forehead
upon the mat between her little olive-hued hands,
and her body quivering with an excess of emotion
which even a lifetime of training could not enable
her to repress.</p>

<p>Yoritomo gazed down upon her as serenely
impassive in look as a bronze Buddha. Yet
beneath his placid tone even I could detect the
hidden note of tenderness: “Kohana, we have
come to you from a long journey.”</p>

<p>“My lord!” she murmured, “to my lowly
house first of all!”</p>

<p>She rose to her knees and gazed into his face
with a look of such radiant love and devotion
that I forgot on the instant my suspicion of her
loyalty. And in the same moment I forgave
the thick powdering of rice flour upon her face,
and the dark red stain of thistle juice upon her
lips, and the greasy pomade with which her hair
was matted and stiffened.</p>

<p>For a minute or more the lovers sat silent
and motionless, gazing into one another’s eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Yoritomo gravely smiling, Kohana melting to
happy tears. That was their greeting after three
years of separation!</p>

<p>“Tomo,” I whispered in English, “do you not
see how she has waited and longed for you all the
time since you left her? Console her for the past!
I will go out and leave you.”</p>

<p>“Do not trouble,” he replied. “Have I not
told you that we Japanese do not kiss and
embrace?” He turned and spoke to the girl,
who was glancing at me out of the corners of her
long eyes with intense curiosity: “Kohana, my
brother is weary, and we have not bathed in two
days.”</p>

<p>“My lord! no bath in two days!” she gasped,
and she clapped her hands sharply. There sounded
an answering “<i>Hai!</i>” and the little serving maid
appeared at the end of the room&mdash;“Quick, girl!
see that the bath is heated.”</p>

<p>As the child trotted away, Yoritomo peered
out through the open side of the room into the dim
garden. “Close the <i>shoji</i>,” he ordered.</p>

<p>Kohana hastened across, and from either end
of the room drew white paper screens out along
the slotted sill and lintel-beams, until the room
was shut in from the garden. Within a minute
she was again kneeling before us. Yoritomo
smiled into her beaming face, and said: “You
will now be honored by seeing the countenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
of my august brother. He is my friend and
benefactor.”</p>

<p>At the word, I lifted off my deep-brimmed hat
and looked at her, smiling. What she had expected
to see I cannot say. My oval face and even my
nose might easily have passed for Japanese, and
my cheeks were tanned almost to the darkness of
Yoritomo’s. But the two days’ stubble upon my
lip and chin was very thick for the beard of an
Oriental, and my forehead much too white, while
yet far more my round blue eyes spoke of a terrifying
world all unknown to this gentle girl. Before
my look her eyes widened and purpled with terror.
She sank down at my feet in speechless fear.</p>

<p>“Is it so Kohana welcomes my friend and
brother?” asked Yoritomo in quiet reproach.
“There is nothing to fear.”</p>

<p>The girl straightened and gazed up at me, wide-eyed
yet with a smile on her trembling lips.
“<i>Tojin sama!</i> forgive the rudeness of one who is
foolish and ignorant! Accept the humble greetings
of your servant!”</p>

<p>“Is the <i>tojin</i> so fearful a beast or devil in the eyes
of Kohana San that she still trembles?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Woroto Sama is my friend and brother. He
has been my benefactor during all my travels
among the <i>tojin</i>,” added Yoritomo.</p>

<p>“Among the <i>tojin</i>, my lord! You have travelled
among the barbarians?&mdash;beyond the sea?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
“To the five continents. I sailed away with
Woroto Sama towards the rising sun, and sailed
back with him from the setting sun. The world
is an enormous ball, Kohana, and I have been
around it as a gnat might crawl around Fujiyama.”</p>

<p>“My lord is no gnat!” she laughed. “I do
not understand. Even Fuji-san rests broadly
upon the back of Dai Nippon, and Dai Nippon
upon the back of the great fish. How then could my
lord go beneath? Did my lord see the great fish?”</p>

<p>“I saw greater things than the fish of our myth.
Beyond the seas are lands vastly greater than
Nippon. I have sailed in the black ships and seen
the power of the <i>tojin</i>. Tell me quickly. Has
word come of the fleet from America?”</p>

<p>“No more, my lord, than a message from the
<i>tojin</i> at Deshima that the black ships had sailed
for Dai Nippon and would force the Shogunate
to open other ports than Nagasaki.”</p>

<p>Yoritomo’s eyes glowed. “We are in time,
brother! All now turns upon the wisdom or
folly of the Elder Council.”</p>

<p>Kohana rose to her feet barely in time to mask
my face from the gaze of the child-maid. She
had returned to announce that the bath was ready.</p>

<p>“Go bid the landlord prepare his best dishes
for my guests. Then see that no one enters
unannounced,” said her mistress.</p>

<div id="ip_98" class="figcenter" style="width: 401px;"><img src="images/i_111.jpg" width="401" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">She Dropped Her Blue Robe from Her Graceful Shoulders</span></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
The child turned away in smiling obedience.
Yoritomo signed me to rise and follow Kohana,
who took up a lantern and thrust open one of
the screens of the inner wall. We walked along
a smooth planked passage twenty or thirty paces
to a little room with sloping slatted floor. Beside
the door stood clothes-racks, on which hung thin
towels of cotton print. Three or four buckets
of cold water ranged along the wall, and at the
lower end, half sunk below the level of the floor,
was a great tub, or wide-mouthed barrel, from
which warm vapors were beginning to rise.</p>

<p>The <i>geisha</i> hung her lantern to a convenient
hook, and unwrapped her long crepe <i>obi</i>, or sash.
In a moment she had slipped off her gold-brocaded
robe and disclosed a still more beautiful under
<i>kimono</i> of azure silk embroidered with gold dragons.
Loosening the inner <i>obi</i>, she dropped her blue
robe from her graceful shoulders, and stood before
us as nude and as unconscious as the nymph of
the public bath. Though I was aware that she
was a member of a profession that her people
class little above the courtesans, one look into her
earnest, smiling face convinced me that her
thoughts were innocent of all immodesty.</p>

<p>“Our customs are not the customs of the
Occident, but they are now your customs,
Woroto,” said Yoritomo, and he ungirt his priest
robe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
There was no escape, and my hesitancy was
brief. My friend had submitted to many customs
repugnant to him, in my country. Since this
was a custom of his country, I could do no less.
His matter-of-fact manner, taken with the girl’s
naive unconsciousness of all wrong, helped me to
realize that true modesty and purity are of the
spirit and not of outward convention.</p>

<p>The ordeal was no light one, yet long before the
bath was finished I had begun to forget my embarrassment
in the girl’s ecstasies of wonder and
delight over the whiteness of my skin. Though
distinctly a brunette in all else than the color of
my eyes, I seemed marvellously fair to this daughter
of the Orient, whose own skin was of the olive
tint of southern Italy and Spain.</p>

<p>With strict impartiality she aided our ablutions
with the cold water, and then, at a sign from
Yoritomo, led me first to the tub. It was scalding
hot, yet the girl betrayed surprise when I
insisted upon the addition of two cooling buckets
before I would venture in. Even with that I
was almost parboiled before Kohana had finished
shaving my friend and dressing his hair.</p>

<p>When at last he came to take my place in purgatory,
the girl deftly set about drying and shampooing
me, still exclaiming upon the fairness of
my skin, though it was now far other than “snow
white.” Having dried the “honorable <i>tojin sama</i>,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
she proceeded to shave my face and crown with
her queer little razor and to reknot my cue. To
my vast relief, she then cast aside my Yamabushi
robe and soiled leggings, and left me to dress myself
in the rich garments I had worn inside my tatters.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX&mdash;<span class="smcap">Nippon’s Greetings</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap1">Cleansed</span> and refreshed, we returned
to compose ourselves upon our mats
in the guest-room, while Kohana San,
once more resplendent in gala dress,
hastened out for our dinner. We
were not long kept waiting. She returned with
a lacquered tray, or rather, a low table, twelve
or fourteen inches high. This she placed before
me, and was out and back again in a few minutes
with a similar tray for Yoritomo.</p>

<p>Each tray held many little bowls of steaming
hot food and a pair of plain chopsticks, cut from
a single piece of wood and not yet split apart
at the upper end. At first I hesitated to begin
eating under the eyes of this most cultured of
<i>geishas</i>, but my single biscuit and the handful
of persimmons had served only to whet my appetite,
and the savory odors of many of the dishes
before me were very tempting.</p>

<p>After a thimbleful of hot <i>sake</i>, a curious bittersweet
wine made of fermented rice, we fell to on
the dinner, which Kohana served with utmost
deftness and grace, ever alert to refill our porcelain
<i>sake</i> cups between dishes. The meal was odder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
than any I had eaten even in China,&mdash;soup,
omelet, fishballs, and sponge cake; soup, boiled
crawfish, lotus-root salad, and salted plums; thin
soup, sweetmeats, pickled bamboo shoots, and
stewed cuttlefish; thick soup, sliced duck, and
stewed vegetables; sea slugs with soy sauce,
loquats stewed with sugar, soup, more soup,
and last of all plain boiled rice, without sugar&mdash;which
is scarce in Japan,&mdash;and without milk&mdash;which
is unknown.</p>

<p>Throughout the eating of this odd medley of
exotic dishes, Kohana was either pattering out
to her kitchen, or back with trays held level with
her forehead, or replenishing our <i>sake</i> cups from
her heated flask of the amber wine. The time
came when we could eat no more. The last dish
was removed, and Kohana set before us a tray
with smoking materials and an embossed copper-lined
brazier, or <i>hibachi</i>, in which a few twigs of
charcoal glowed upon a bed of ashes. I had
smoked too often in Japanese fashion with Yoritomo’s
outfit not to know how to roll a pellet
of tobacco and fill the tiny silver bowl of the pipe
now offered me.</p>

<p>As we settled back on our cushions and drew
slowly at the silver mouthpieces, our hostess rose
and began to dance for our entertainment. Well
was she named the best dancer in Yedo! Unlike
our Western <i>artistes</i>, she did not glide about, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
stood in one place, seldom shifting her feet, yet
swaying body and arms and head in movements
of enravishing grace and beauty. For one of the
dances she withdrew, to reappear in a <i>haori</i>
whose gorgeously embroidered sleeves, fluttering
from her extended arms, suggested to me the
movements of a butterfly even before Yoritomo
explained that the performance was called the
Butterfly Dance.</p>

<p>My friend had, however, graver matters in
mind than amusement. In consideration of my
pleasure, he had waited this long. Now he made
a slight gesture, and the girl sank down, flushed
and smiling. He spoke with austere abruptness:
“Enough of play. When I went upon my travels,
Kohana said she would be my eye and ear in Yedo.”</p>

<p>“My lord knows that few things fail to reach
the ear of the free <i>geisha</i>.”</p>

<p>“Begin. Dai Nippon has been a sealed book
to me since I sailed from Kagoshima in the black
ship with Woroto Sama.”</p>

<p>She kowtowed and whispered: “There has
been no change at Kyoto.”</p>

<p>He bowed low at the veiled reference to the
mysterious Mikado. “And Yedo?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Again she kowtowed, though not so low. “His
Highness, Minamoto Iyeyoshi, is still Sei-i-tai
Shogun. Iyesada Sama, his august son, is no
stronger either in head or body.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
“The Council of Elders?”</p>

<p>“Midzuano Echizen-no-kami is now head of
the Council. He does not enjoy the favor of the
Household.”</p>

<p>Yoritomo nodded slightly. “The <i>Gosanke</i>?”</p>

<p>“My lord’s august father, Owari dono, enjoys
excellent health. My lord’s august elder brother,
Mori&mdash;” she hesitated, “he is not so well.”</p>

<p>She said nothing as to his mother, and he did
not inquire, but sat silent, apparently meditating
on her last words. I surmised that they carried
a meaning beyond my knowledge of the idiom.
When, after a few moments, he lifted his lowered
lids, she went on without prompting: “The Prince
of Kii is still given over to the pleasures of his
women, the <i>No</i> dances, and the exploits of his
wrestlers. His august heir is still a child, and
Kii dono has not adopted an elder son to take
over the burden of the title.”</p>

<p>“The child may become a factor should Iyesada
Sama depart this life before his august father,”
said Yoritomo.</p>

<p>“My lord!” exclaimed the girl, “the choice
of the Mito faction is well known to be set on
Keiki, who has been adopted by the Hitotsubashi
family. He is the favorite of his father.”</p>

<p>“The former Prince of Mito!” muttered Yoritomo,
his handsome face distorted with the first
look of hatred and anger I had ever known him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
to betray. “Old Rekko, lord of the frogs in the
well! When I left he was still imprisoned in
one of his secondary palaces.”</p>

<p>“His Highness the Shogun holds steadfast
to the counsel of your august father and of Ii
Kamon-no-kami. Keiki has won over the Council
of Elders, but the Household is with my lord’s
party.”</p>

<p>“Satsuma also is with us. He does not forget
that my father brought about the marriage of his
adopted daughter to Iyesada,” said Yoritomo.</p>

<p>“Over-confidence is a traitor in camp, my
lord. Always before this, Kii has stood with
Owari against Mito, until the saying has become
a proverb that no son of Mito can be chosen to
sit on the stool of the Shoguns. But now Kii
swims in pleasure, and Owari stands alone against
Mito. Keiki aims high. My lord has read how
Hideyoshi, though barred from the title of Shogun,
attained to the higher office of Kwambaku.”</p>

<p>“He would climb to greater power on the ruins
of the Shogunate!” muttered Yoritomo.</p>

<p>“Either Shogun or Kwambaku,” replied the
girl. “And what chance has he of the first as
against my lord, should Iyesada Sama go from
us and leave the heirship in doubt?”</p>

<p>Yoritomo gravely shook his head. “My life
is given. If I live, it will not be to sit on the seat
of Iyeyasu my forefather. Our choice is the child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
of Kii dono. I have overcome passion. The
thought of power does not tempt me.”</p>

<p>Kohana prostrated herself at his feet, with a
soft insucking of her breath. “My lord has overcome
all passion and desire! He has entered upon
his Buddhahood!”</p>

<p>“Far from it, foolish girl!” he exclaimed. “My
heart is black with hatred of my father’s enemies,
the real enemies of Dai Nippon, and I burn with
desire to win glory in the service of the sacred
Mikado. I am far indeed from the blessed peace
of Buddhahood.&mdash;Tell me, has Keiki made any
open move?”</p>

<p>“Not as yet, my lord,” she replied, straightening
and glancing apprehensively about the room,
“not yet! But&mdash;” her voice sank to a whisper&mdash;“his
plans are laid to win the release of his
father. With the old Prince of Mito free and high
in the favor of Iyeyoshi, my lord can easily
foretell&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The plans?” demanded Yoritomo.</p>

<p>The girl began to breathe quickly. “My lord
has heard how it is said that the Princess Azai
holds the place that should be Iyesada’s in the
heart of their august father. It is unbelievable
that a parent should consider a daughter before
a son, yet this has come to me in a way that
leaves no room for doubt. My lord, would a
father turn his face away from one who had saved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
his heir from the blades of drunken <i>ronins</i>? The
Princess Azai is more to His Highness than is
his heir.”</p>

<p>“Keiki thinks to win favor by a trick!”</p>

<p>“To-morrow, after midday, when the Princess
is returning from worship at Zozoji, there will be
<i>ronins</i> waiting. Blows will be struck. They will
bear off the <i>norimon</i> of the august lady. Keiki
will rush to the rescue. What wonder if a fond
father soon signs the pardon of the rescuer’s
parent?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow, after midday,” repeated Yoritomo,
in a voice still and impassive as his face. He
turned to me. “You will do well to get a full
night’s rest, brother. We have work before us.”</p>

<p>“But what’s in the wind, Tomo?” I demanded
in English, as Kohana ran to draw out a pair of
silk quilts from a drawer in the lesser recess of the
<i>tokonoma</i>.</p>

<p>“There’ll be the devil to pay,” answered my
friend, the glint in his narrowed eyes boding ill
for the “devil.” He nodded towards Kohana.
“I will tell you more fully in the morning.”</p>

<p>The hint was sufficient. I rose and followed
the girl down a short passage to a small room that
was to be my sleeping chamber. She prepared
my bed by spreading the two quilts on the soft
mats of the floor and placing at the head a little
lacquered box rounded on the top with a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
roll of soft paper. This was the pillow. Over
all she hung a large canopy of mosquito netting.
There remained only for her to light a tiny night-lamp,
kowtow, and withdraw. Five minutes later
I was fast asleep, with my jaw upon the paper
pad of my wooden pillow.</p>

<p>How soon my dreams began and how long they
continued I have not the slightest idea. But
I had a prolonged succession of the most fantastic
visions imaginable, in which brown-skinned, slant-eyed
elves and gnomes, clad in outlandish costume,
were ever committing <i>outré</i> and unexpected antics.
Sometimes the performance was of grotesque
horror, as when severed heads, dripping blood,
flew at me with malignant ferocity. This must
have come from a blending of Yoritomo’s Japanese
goblin tales with the ghastly spectacle of the
execution-pillory outside Shinagawa.</p>

<p>After a time I found myself sauntering through
an Oriental Paradise in company with a Buddhist
angel, who bowed down and worshipped me as
the God of Snow. Immediately I became a
snow image, fast melting to liquid beneath the
noontime sun. I melted and flowed away down
through a fetid rice field, into the blue Bay of
Yedo. Too late I discovered that my angel was
none other than the beautiful Princess Azai,
daughter of the Shogun.</p>

<p>I was now aboard a Japanese junk, flying up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
the bay to save the Princess from the guns of the
American fleet. The giant steam frigates were
fast overhauling my slow craft, their decks cleared
for action and their gun-ports swung open, tier
above tier, ready for the bombardment of ill-fated
Yedo. Suddenly the junk struck upon a
shoal, over which it was driven by the billows,
only to strike again and again. As the mast
went by the board and the hull crunched to
splinters under my feet, the stately <i>Susquehanna</i>,
flying the blue-starred broad pennant of Commodore
Perry, swung around and fired a thunderous
broadside into our shattered wreck.</p>

<p>With a shout of terror, I leaped up, and found
myself reeling about a matted floor, in the dim
light of a tiny lamp. An instant later the floor
heaved and rocked under me with a sickening
motion that flung me to my knees. All around
I could hear the creak and groan of straining
timbers. Above me my dizzy eyes made out a
ceiling of odd-patterned bamboo-work and swaying
walls whose gilt panels glinted in the faint light.</p>

<p>The screens of the end wall suddenly brightened,
then shot open, and through the gap Yoritomo
came darting towards me, lantern in hand.</p>

<p>“Earthquake!” he cried, springing across to
extinguish my little night-lamp, which was on
the point of jarring from its shelf.</p>

<p>The floor steadied with the passing of the shock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
I crawled from under the mosquito net and
staggered to my feet. Yoritomo seized me by
the sleeve, and dragged me out the way he had
come. I heard Kohana calling to us to hasten.
We turned a corner, and saw her dart towards us
across a room, beyond which gleamed a square of
early daylight. Again the floor lurched. We all
three sprawled prone upon the mats, while about
us the rafters and beams creaked louder than
before and the walls seemed toppling to crush us.</p>

<p>“This way!&mdash;the shutters are open&mdash;this
way, my lord!” shrilled Kohana. She plucked
at Yoritomo’s sleeve, and scrambled back, tossing
about in a manner that would have been irresistibly
comic but for the terror of the moment.</p>

<p>We followed as best we could, now crawling, now
staggering half erect, like drunkards. Through
it all Yoritomo clung fast to his lantern, too
dazed to extinguish it, yet fearfully conscious of the
peril of fire. All around me things were reeling.
I clutched at a swaying wall-post, a few feet short
of the gap in the wooden shutters that closed
in the outer side of the veranda. Before I could
glance about, a fearful shock flung me across the
veranda and out into a bed of roses.</p>

<p>To my sorrow, I found that roses in Japan have
thorns. Also I caught a glimpse of the massive
tiled eaves seemingly about to pitch upon me.
I leaped out of the roses, clear across a path,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
and fetched up with a skip and a trip, coming
down squarely in a bed of purple irises. In perfect
unison with my own arrival at stability, the earth
spasms ceased as suddenly as they had begun.</p>

<p>From behind a bush on my left a voice murmured
in quavering, gurgling delight: “My lord, you are
safe, unharmed?”</p>

<p>“Unharmed,” answered Yoritomo, and he called
in an anxious tone, “Woroto!”</p>

<p>“All present and accounted for,” I replied,
rising dizzily, to face them across the bush in the
red dawnlight. “You are not hurt, Kohana
San?”</p>

<p>“Nor my lord!” she cried, with a soft chuckle
of delight. “After all it was only a little wriggle
of the fish’s tail.”</p>

<p>“Fish’s tail?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“The great fish upon whose back rests the land
of Dai Nippon,” explained Yoritomo, with a
twinkle in his black eyes.</p>

<p>“If my lords will pardon the rudeness of their
servant, she will go in and prepare the morning
bath for them,” said Kohana, and before I
could protest against such rashness, she hastened
up across the veranda, into the house.</p>

<p>“Tomo!” I exclaimed, “you let her go, when
the house may fall any moment! It must be
shattered! That little wriggle was a cataclysm.”</p>

<p>“The shock was sharper than the usual weekly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
tremor,” he admitted. “But the house is built
to withstand all but the heaviest quakes. The
massive roof takes up the vibration of the shock,
which is already broken at the loose post joints.”</p>

<p>Following his gesture, I looked under the house,
through the open lattice-work, and saw that the
house posts rested each with its hollow foot
perched upon the round point of a half-embedded
boulder. He nodded reassuringly, and led the
way back into the house. Within I found the
mortised beams and panelled woodwork unharmed
by the earthquake. Thanks to the absence of
plaster and standing furniture, the only result of
the shocks had been to fill the rooms with dust
and upset the vase with the jasmine spray in the
<i>tokonoma</i> of the guest chamber.</p>

<p>Yoritomo smiled and pointed to the undisturbed
bronze kitten. “It is hard to disconcert a <i>geisha</i> or
her god. Kohana will soon have the bath heated.
After that, breakfast and a morning of delight.
No other <i>geisha</i> in Dai Nippon can dance as
dances Kohana.”</p>

<p>“Morning?” I repeated. “But the feigned
attack of Keiki upon the daughter of the Shogun?”</p>

<p>“There is ample time, and the more we refresh
ourselves the better.”</p>

<p>“Tell me more of the plot. Is it possible the
government spies can be deceived by such a
farce?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
“Death is never a farce.”</p>

<p>“Death?”</p>

<p>“You have heard me speak of <i>ronins</i>,&mdash;<i>samurais</i>
who, because of their own offences or
the death of their <i>daimios</i>, have become masterless
men. Whether scholars, teachers, or criminals,
all alike are men for whose acts their former lords
cannot be held responsible.”</p>

<p>“And who no longer owe loyalty to their lords,”
I added.</p>

<p>“Not in law,” he assented. “But suppose
certain loyal retainers became <i>ronins</i> at the
bidding of their master? The <i>samurai</i> code says
that a man shall serve his lord even to the death.
What greater joy to the Mito men than to give
their lives for the freeing of their prince?”</p>

<p>“You should hasten to warn the Shogun!”
I exclaimed.</p>

<p>He smiled in gentle reproof of my heat. “There
are guards at the gateways of all bridges across
the inner moat, and within are officials interested
in barring out the bearer of a warning message.
Remember, Keiki has won the favor of Midzuano,
chief of the Council of Elders. Yet suppose the
message should penetrate to the august ear of
Iyeyoshi Sama. What follows? The Princess
does not go to worship at the temple of Zozoji;
no blows are struck; small credit accrues to the
tale-bearer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
“You would risk the life of the Shogun’s
daughter&mdash;of the princess to whom you are
betrothed!”</p>

<p>“There will be no risk of life&mdash;for her,” he
replied.</p>

<p>“But the shock?&mdash;her terror?”</p>

<p>“The most delicate of our ladies are taught to
withstand fear.”</p>

<p>“Consider the indignity to be suffered by a
princess, your kinsman,” I argued.</p>

<p>“What matters the terror or the death or even
the dishonor of a woman, weighed in the balance
against that which I seek to accomplish? No;
whatever the cost, I must win a favorable audience
with the Shogun, for the sake of Dai Nippon
and the sacred Mikado! It is a rare chance for us,
Woroto. We will take part in Keiki’s badger
game.”</p>

<p>“And, like the fox, snap the game from between
his paws,” I punned.</p>

<p>He nodded. “With the aid of Kohana, we
are to become priests of the official Jodo sect.”</p>

<p>“You said the Yamabushi are Buddhists. Why
change?”</p>

<p>“Iyeyasu built Zozoji for the Jodo sect. They
have charge of the temple and the tombs of the
four Shoguns who are buried at Shiba Park.
Therefore we go as Jodo priests, lately arrived
from Kyoto.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
“With sharp arguments and loud words for
the Mito <i>ronins</i>,” I added.</p>

<p>He caught at my sleeve. “Not that!&mdash;not
your pistols, brother. To fire a gun within the
bounds of Yedo is certain death!”</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Princess Azai</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Noon</span> found us ready for the start,
our swords girt on under the flowing
priest robes, and hats drawn low
to shade our faces. Upon our feet
iron-shod sandals were bound firmly
over the white silk foot mittens, in keeping with
our role of monks of noble blood, vowed to a
pilgrimage to Zozoji and just in off the road. But
the hilts of our swords were within convenient
reach inside the edge of our robes, and, despite
Yoritomo’s warning, my revolvers were no less
ready. I assured him, however, that they would
not be used unless the occasion justified.</p>

<p>When it came to the parting, I looked to see
Kohana protest or at least shed a tear over this
short ending of her lover’s visit. After three
weary years of absence he had come back to her
for a single night, and was now going from her
again, it might be to his death. Yet she neither
wept nor betrayed any other sign of grief.
Smilingly she conducted us from her house and
down the path to the gateway, where he signed
her to stop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
“If all goes well,” he said, “I will send for you
or come again to Shinagawa.”</p>

<p>She kowtowed, with a softly murmured word of
parting, “<i>Saionara!</i>”</p>

<p>“Farewell, Kohana San,” I responded. “The
<i>tojin</i> carries away with him grateful thoughts of
his kind and beautiful hostess.”</p>

<p>“Gracious indeed is the condescension of the
august lord in deigning to overlook the conduct
of one so rude and ignorant,” she said. Yoritomo
was swinging away at a rapid stride. She rose
quickly, and held out her hands, clasped palm
to palm. Her eyes gazed up into mine, full
of timid appeal, and her lips quivered with a
pitiful smile. “Woroto Sama is a lord of the
<i>tojin</i>, he is powerful. While he slept I looked at
the strange weapons he bears, and my lord told
me their use. The <i>tojin sama</i> is a friend of Yoritomo
Sama!”</p>

<p>“If they kill him, they kill me,” I answered.</p>

<p>With a swift movement she drew from her
sleeve and pressed into my hand a dirk whose
richly ornamented hilt and sheath told of a precious
blade within. I would have sought to return
the gift, but she sank down and beat the ground
at my feet with her forehead. I thrust the dirk
in beside my sword, and turned away, feeling
that this girl of a despised profession had honored
me with her trust and gratitude. Indeed, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
might say she had ennobled me, since I had needed
the dirk to become a <i>samurai</i>, a two-sword gentleman.</p>

<p>With hat brim down, hands demurely folded
within priestly sleeves, and body waddling <i>samurai</i>-fashion
from the weight of cartridges about my
waist, I followed after my friend across the beautiful
little landscape garden of the teahouse.
There were many guests strolling along the shaded
walks or lunching in the little kiosks which from
the crest of a terrace looked out over the blue
bay. But, unheeded either by guests or attendants,
we passed up the garden and out through a wicket
gate in the wall across from the teahouse.</p>

<p>As we came into the narrow alley upon which
the gate opened, Yoritomo warned me to keep
my hand on my swordhilt. On either side, preening
themselves behind barred verandas, I saw rows
of pretty young girls clad in gorgeous robes.
We had entered a street given over to the <i>joro</i>,
or courtesans. Throughout the length of the
lane, <i>samurais</i> flushed with <i>sake</i> and evil-eyed
<i>ronins</i> swaggered aggressively up and down, with
swords cocked high in their girdles.</p>

<p>Twice we saw pairs of swashbucklers draw upon
each other, but hurried past while their blades were
yet clashing together in furious cut and parry.
Without looking back or so much as glancing to
right or left, we swung ahead through the groups<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
of cut-throats and drunkards, and our steadiness,
together with the priest robes, won us safe passage
to the Tokaido.</p>

<p>Along the highway vice was for the most part
masked behind the disguise of legitimate teahouse
entertainment, and the rakes and ruffians bore
themselves with a less truculent manner among the
light-hearted smiling throngs of travellers and
townfolk.</p>

<p>As we swung into the busy thoroughfare I
caught my first view of Yedo, a view impressive
only in the vastness of the city’s extent. Built
in great part on low-lying ground, it stretched
out along the curve of the shallow bayhead and
inland to the northward, in a sea of gray unpainted
roofs, partly relieved by an occasional temple or
red-roofed pagoda rising among groves of trees.
In the midst of this dull expanse rose an island
of low hills, upon whose wooded crests the moated
official quarter was built about the citadel-palace
of the Shogun.</p>

<p>A mile along the high embankment which
guards all the upper curve of the bay brought us
to the black gate on the boundary between Shinagawa
and Yedo. A few steps beyond it Yoritomo
significantly drew my attention to a roofed notice-board,
covered in large Chinese characters with
the ancient edicts against Christianity. Shortly
after he pointed out a temple in which were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
tombs of the forty-seven loyal <i>ronins</i> and the lord
for whose sake they achieved vengeance and
martyrdom.</p>

<p>Somewhat farther on we left the Tokaido and
angled off inland from the bay towards a great
park called Shiba. It is formed of the grounds
of Zozoji and its many subsidiary temples, tombs,
and monastery buildings. A high-arched wooden
bridge carried us over a canal, or tide-water
stream, whose waters swarmed with the sampans
of fishermen and roofed produce boats from up
country.</p>

<p>A little beyond this muddy stream we entered
the lovely cool glades of Shiba. The place was
an Oriental paradise of giant trees and blooming
shrubs, from which sounded the merry note of
twittering birds, blended and dominated by the
flute-like song of the Japanese nightingale; while
about the smaller of the temples lotus leaves and
blooming irises rose above the still waters of ponds
stocked with tortoises and goldfish.</p>

<p>Yoritomo gravely led the way across this rear
portion of the sacred park, along stately avenues
of giant pines and cryptomerias and camphor
trees, between rows of stone lanterns, under
<i>torii</i> of wood and stone and bronze, and past
grotesque bronze images, to enclosures where
broad and massive temples shouldered up the
ponderous weight of their gray-tiled roofs. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
came out into the main road and turned along
it a short distance to the entrance of Zozoji, a
magnificent two-storied gate guarded on either
side by hideous red and green demons.</p>

<p>“<i>Namu Amida Butsu!</i>” chanted my friend,
and mingling with a crowd of worshippers, we
passed through the ancient gateway into the great
courtyard about Zozoji.</p>

<p>The temple stood at the head of a flight of red
steps, and, with its huge red pillars and enormous
Chinese roof of gray tiles, was by far the most
imposing edifice I had yet seen in Japan. A
mighty sonorous boom smote upon our ears. I
looked to the right, and saw a priest swinging a
suspended beam against the rim of an immense bell.</p>

<p>Yoritomo turned across to a building on our
left, and between the thunderous peals of the
great bell addressed a young priest who was
writing in the veranda. I could not follow their
low conversation, but presently I saw my friend
hand the priest one of his gold coins, in return for
a slip of paper. After this we joined another
group of worshippers, climbed the temple stairway,
and, transferring our sandals to our bosoms,
glided in upon the mats of the great hall. We
stopped a little way inside, between the great
lacquered contribution-chest and a superb dragon-wrought
brazier from which was rising clouds of
incense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
Yoritomo stared for some moments into the
gloom of the vast interior, shook his head slowly
and edged about to watch the courtyard and gate.
My experience in China had already acquainted
me with the many startling resemblances between
Catholic Christianity and Buddhism in respect
to priestly costumes, ceremonial, and houses of
worship. Yet I found much to interest me in
the gorgeous panelled ceilings, the carvings and
arabesques and bronze-work of this grand temple.</p>

<p>At the far end, within the railed space that I
might call the chancel, appeared the high altar,
crowded about with the shrines of various images,
colossal candlesticks and lotus blossoms of silver,
bells and drums for the use of the officiating
priests, memorial tablets, bronze offerings, and
emblematic banners. All about the hall on the
soft matting moved crowds of priests and
worshippers, tapping bells, murmuring prayers,
clapping hands, and bowing before the many
shrines.</p>

<p>A touch from Yoritomo drew my gaze around.
I looked out into the dazzling sunlight of the courtyard,
and saw the crowds falling back on either
side before a band of <i>samurais</i>. In the midst
of the band was a gilded <i>norimon</i>, beside which
walked two silk-clad women.</p>

<p>“She comes. Follow,” whispered Yoritomo.</p>

<p>He led the way up the dim-lit hall to the chancel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
and showed the paper he had bought from the
young priest to an old monk in chasuble and stole.
The priest eyed us sharply and stood hesitating
until Yoritomo slipped a gold piece into his itching
palm. At that he led us in behind the bronze
screen, or rail, and left us bowing in a recessed
shrine before a huge many-handed image of
Kwannon, the Goddess of Mercy.</p>

<p>Hardly had we gained this post of vantage
when the sudden hush throughout the temple told
of the entrance of the Shogun’s daughter. Though
she had come incognito, a glance around the corner
of our niche showed me the mass of the worshippers
kneeling with forehead to floor. Through
their midst advanced the cortege of the Princess,
led by the venerable abbot, who, according to
my friend, was a blood kinsman of the mysterious
Mikado.</p>

<p>Fearful of discovery, Yoritomo drew me back
into the denser shadow of the shrine. Soon,
however, I heard the soft rustling of silk garments,
followed by low murmurs and sibilant insuckings
of breath. Aflame with curiosity, I turned half
about, and ventured to raise my hat brim for a
sidelong glance.</p>

<p>The lord abbot had passed on up to the high
altar. But the Princess Azai stood only a few
paces distant, a little in advance of her kowtowing
women and <i>samurais</i>. She was looking up at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
the benevolent features of Kwannon in the gloom
above us. The outline of her dusky hair blurred
into the dark background, but her face, as if
framed about with black velvet, stood out distinct
in all the pure loveliness of an Italian Madonna’s.</p>

<p>Overlapping <i>kimonos</i> of gold-wrought rose and
azure crepes draped her about in graceful folds
from the base of her round white throat to her
tiny feet, and her hands were hidden in sleeves
whose tips almost swept the floor. Beautiful
as was her dress, it won from me only a passing
glance. My eyes returned to feast themselves
on the innocent tender beauty of her face.</p>

<p>Her complexion, untouched by any cosmetic,
was of an ivory whiteness, slightly tinged on the
cheeks with rose. The adorably curved lips of
her little mouth were of a clear coral red. Below
her delicate high-arched brows her black oval
eyes gazed out between the long lashes with the
mildness of a young child’s and the divinely sweet
artlessness of budding maidenhood.</p>

<p>Forgetful of all else in my wonder and delight,
I thrust my hat brim higher and faced square
about. A projecting corner of the shrine masked
me from the kneeling attendants, but not from the
Princess. Drawn by the intensity of my gaze, she
lowered her glance and looked full into my face.
On the instant, I knew from the widening of her
eyes and the quick rise of her little bosom that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
had made out my features through the shadow of
our dim niche.</p>

<p>Yoritomo’s voice breathed softly in my ear,
“Do not move!”</p>

<p>I waited, breathless, expecting to see the Princess
cry out or sink down as had Kohana. Yet, great
as was the awe and wonder in her dilated eyes, she
neither shrank away nor called upon the guard to
protect her from the blue-eyed apparition. Such
perfect control on the part of a girl so delicately
nurtured, so exquisitely refined in look and bearing,
was more than I could withstand. Regardless
of Yoritomo’s warning, I raised my head higher,
and sought to express in a smile the utmost of
my admiration for her courage and beauty.</p>

<p>Again her bosom rose and fell to a quick-drawn
breath, and her lustrous eyes widened yet more.
But the god or devil&mdash;whatever he might be&mdash;had
been pleased to regard her with a kindly
look. Etiquette, if not respect and gratitude,
called for a polite response. A row of little pearls
gleamed between her smiling red lips, and her
lissome young body bent low in gracious obeisance.</p>

<div id="ip_126" class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><img src="images/i_141.jpg" width="400" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Row of Little Pearls Gleamed between Her
Smiling Red Lips</span></div></div>

<p>Instantly Yoritomo grasped my arm and drew
me around the far corner of the shrine. Before
the Princess had straightened from her bow, we
were slipping out through a narrow doorway into
the broad veranda of the temple. The sudden
vanishing of the priest-robed apparition must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
seemed to her clear confirmation of its godly
or ghostly nature.</p>

<p>In the veranda I would have stopped to whisper
my blissful impressions of the girl’s beauty, had
not my friend snatched his sandals from his
bosom and imperatively signed me to strap on my
own. The moment our footgear was secure, he
hastened down around the rear of the temple and
out through a postern, into a winding road that
led us past the enclosures of two or three mortuary
chapels. Had the occasion been different, I might
have pressed my friend to show me these magnificent
memorial tombs and temples of departed
Shoguns. As it was, he did not pause until we
had passed down a long row of stone lanterns and
out through one of the beautiful secondary gates
of Shiba.</p>

<p>At last he stopped in a vacant space, and turned
to reproach me with mild friendliness: “You should
not have so risked discovery, brother!”</p>

<p>“How could I help it?” I demanded. “She
is very beautiful, Tomo! Candidly, I envy you
your good fortune.”</p>

<p>He gazed into my glowing face, his own quickly
stilling to the placid Buddha calm. “Form is
an empty mask, a nothingness,” he murmured.
“The love of women, the craving for power, the
greed for gold,&mdash;all alike are lures to decoy the
soul out of the upward path to Nirvana.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
“You have seen your future bride, and can
speak of Nirvana!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“She is as pure and beautiful as an angel. Yet
I looked into her luminous eyes and did not see
my soul.”</p>

<p>“I saw <i>her</i> soul, you cold-blooded Buddhist!
Her spirit is as beautiful as her face!”</p>

<p>“No, Woroto,&mdash;it was your own soul you
saw shining in her eyes,” he replied.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” I demanded.</p>

<p>He shook his head gently. “Who may penetrate
the mysteries of the future? You may have
loved her in some previous incarnation. As for
me, I have given my life to the Son of Heaven,
the holy Mikado.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rout of the Ronins</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap1">For</span> an hour or more we loitered about
within view of the great gate of Zozoji,
waiting for the cortege of the Shogun’s
daughter to march out on its return trip
to the citadel. That the Princess would
come back through the main entrance was evident
from the fact that the <i>norimons</i> of her ladies-in-waiting
were stationed in the road at one side
of the grand carved portal. Yoritomo stood
beneath a camellia tree, seemingly lost in meditation,
but I paced to and fro through the passing
crowds, unable to restrain my impatience.</p>

<p>At last between the meshes of my hat brim I
caught sight of the <i>samurai</i> escort of the Princess
issuing from the gateway. In their lead was the
quick-tempered <i>hatamoto</i> Yuki who had struck
at me from the ferryboat at the passage of the
Rokugu River. The bearers of the <i>norimons</i> moved
around, and as soon as the ladies-in-waiting had
taken their seats, the cortege formed in line,
with one of the <i>norimons</i> before and the other
behind the gold-lacquered palanquin of the Princess.
We drew back behind a hedge of blooming privet.</p>

<p>Soon the cortege marched past us, at a slow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
and stately pace, though the absence of standards
indicated to the public that the noble person
escorted was travelling incognito and dispensed
with the usual kneeling of the common folk along
the road. I examined with intense interest the
sturdy <i>norimon</i> bearers and the score of proud
<i>hatamotos</i>, or shogunate <i>samurais</i>, who made up
Yuki’s company.</p>

<p>These gentlemen-soldiers seemed to me to be
picked men, but they wore no armor and carried
no other weapons than the customary sword and
dirk. Though their petticoat-trousers were neatly
tucked up above the knees in the tops of long
silk stockings, freeing their legs for quick action,
their arms and forebodies were encumbered with
the peculiar gauze-winged ceremonial jackets and
the long sleeves of their <i>haoris</i>.</p>

<p>“That guard looks more like dress parade than
action,” I commented.</p>

<p>“They are the pick of the best swordsmen among
the <i>hatamotos</i>; yet they are all doomed men,”
replied Yoritomo.</p>

<p>I caught at my swordhilt, no longer intent on
the fringe of split bamboo which curtained the
window of the Princess’s <i>norimon</i>. “All doomed?&mdash;And
ourselves?”</p>

<p>“Mito will have planned to sacrifice as few
retainers as possible. But though they will not
be many, they will have the advantage of armor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Our sole chance of success lies in the method of
fence you have taught me. Lunge for face or
neck. Waste no thrusts on mail-clad bodies.”</p>

<p>“We can at least hold them until other rescuers
run up,” I said.</p>

<p>He shook his head doubtfully. “Look down the
bay. A rain-squall is coming. There will be
few in the streets, and if Keiki rushes up first
with his rescue party, we will be cut down with
the <i>ronins</i>. As you say, we are playing against
long odds, but the stake is big.”</p>

<p>“A little hot soy will flavor the rice,” I replied.
“Lead on.”</p>

<p>He shuffled about, and we strolled out and along
the road, keeping half a hundred paces behind
the rearmost of the strutting <i>hatamotos</i>. Leisurely
as was the advance of the cortege, we were soon
clear of Shiba and approaching a hill that Yoritomo
called Atago-yama. The eminence was provided
with two means of ascent, a straight steep stairway
and another one long and winding. The
cortege passed by on one side.</p>

<p>We now descended into a low and thickly
populated quarter, passing at every two hundred
paces one of the gloomy gates which divide off
all the streets of the lower city into wards of fifty
or sixty houses. Each ward was given over to
a particular trade or the sale of a certain article,&mdash;as
a street of blacksmiths, squatting before their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
primitive forges, a street of toy merchants, another
of lacquer-dealers, fan-makers, cabinet-workers,
and so forth.</p>

<p>Shops and people differed little from those I
had already seen, but for the first time I observed
the lofty ladder watch towers, at the top of which
hung firebells. The urgent need of such means
of warning in a city built, for the most part, of
tinder-like materials, was evident from a belt of
ash-covered ground off to our right, in which the
only buildings unburned were a few mud-walled
storehouses.</p>

<p>My roving eye was recalled by a word from
Yoritomo to be on my guard. Kohana had
conjectured that the attack would be made near
one of the moats, and we were approaching a
boat-crowded canal or moat, the outermost of
the line of fortifications that gird in the Shogun’s
palace and the <i>yashikis</i>, or palaces, of the <i>daimios</i>.
I loosened my swordblade in its scabbard, and held
my hand ready to jerk up the skirts of my robes
and tuck them in the back of my girdle.</p>

<p>The cortege moved slowly on down the busy
street and out upon the old wooden bridge that
arched across from the grassy slope of the nearer
bank to the abrupt stone wall which Kämpfer
calls the Outer Castle. We followed, warily
scanning the band of <i>samurais</i> that approached
from the far end of the bridge and the scattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
groups that clattered up behind us through the
crowds of common people. All alike, however,
showed the utmost deference in avoiding close
contact with the attendants of the Princess, and
the crests of their respective <i>daimios</i>, conspicuous
on the backs, breast, and sleeves of their <i>haoris</i>,
proved that they were not <i>ronins</i>.</p>

<p>We plodded after the cortege, across the canal
and through the bastioned gateway on the far
side, out into one of the smooth wide streets of
the official quarter. Here there were no commoners
to be seen, and the few <i>samurais</i> scattered
up and down the broad way were hastening to
shelter before the first gusts of the coming rain-squall.
But even the threatened downpour failed
to hurry the <i>hatamotos</i> out of their stately strut.
Seeing no sign of any <i>ronins</i>, I relaxed my tense
nerves and looked about at the long walls of the
<i>yashikis</i> which lined each side of the street.</p>

<p>I knew that these residences of the <i>daimios</i>
each consisted of a mansion house surrounded by
courts and gardens, all set in the defensive hollow
square of the retainers’ barracks. What I had
failed to picture from Yoritomo’s descriptions was
the extent and odd appearance of these <i>samurai</i>
quarters. One of them stretched along the road
nearly a quarter of a mile, its continuous roof of
red tiles broken only by a grand, ornate gate,
midway of the monotonous façade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
The mortarless stone foundation walls of the
<i>yashikis</i> rose from deep, curbed ditches that
flowed along each side of the street. Above the
high foundations the walls were of diagonally-set
black tiles with wide joints of white plaster.
Well up in this checkerboard surface, rows of
small windows, stoutly barred against attack,
projected in shallow bays.</p>

<p>A turn in the street brought us in view of the
citadel just as the rain-squall came swirling upon
us. Across the head of the street loomed up a
mighty wall of cyclopean masonry, its granite
base deep beneath the placid waters of a broad
moat, its crest crowned with trees and square
pagoda guardtowers. Our street rose to meet
the causeway that ran along the moat bank and
curved in to cross a wooden bridge. At the far
side a huge bastioned gateway led up into the
higher ground of the citadel.</p>

<p>Beyond the trees and pagodas that fringed the
top of the titanic wall, I saw outlined against the
blackening sky the lofty white peak of the “Lord
of Heaven” tower, in the O Shira, or innermost
castle. Then the full force of the storm struck
us and wrapped us about in blinding, swirling
torrents of rain. Yoritomo pressed up close to
me, and bent over to make himself heard above
the howls of the wind and the drumming splatter
of the deluge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
“Be ready!” he warned. “Watch this street
that runs in on the left where the vanguard is
passing&mdash;There is one just beyond, on the right.
At the moat gate is stationed a powerful guard.
If the <i>ronins</i> fail to attack here&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Look!” I cried, grasping at my swordhilt.</p>

<p>Out of the narrow street on the left were streaming
a number of cloaked figures, silent and downbent
as though intent only upon making their way
through the storm. As they filed out into the broad
roadway alongside the <i>norimon</i> of the Princess,
a gust of wind tore open the cloak of one in the
rear and exposed to our gaze the bright links of
chain armor within.</p>

<p>“The <i>ronins</i>!” hissed Yoritomo. “Wait! Make
ready.”</p>

<p>I let go my half-drawn sword, and hastened to
follow his example by tucking my robe skirts in
the back of my girdle and tying up my long sleeves.
In the midst I saw one of the <i>hatamotos</i> turn upon
the nearest <i>ronin</i> with a repellent gesture. Instantly
the assassin drew his sword and struck
a fearful two-handed blow. The head of the
luckless <i>hatamoto</i> leaped from his shoulders and
fell after the blood-gushing corpse into the mud
and water.</p>

<p>At the treacherous blow all the <i>hatamotos</i> who
had seen it yelled with fury and amazement, and
flashed out their swords to strike down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
murderer. But their blades clashed without effect
upon his hidden helmet and armor, and in an
instant the other <i>ronins</i> were beside their chief,
slashing back at the armorless <i>hatamotos</i>. Half
a dozen guardsmen fell beneath the razor-edged
blades, slain outright or hideously maimed, all
in the brief moment before those in the van of the
cortege could turn about and rush to their aid.</p>

<p>I found myself with drawn sword, struggling
frantically to free myself from the grip of my
friend. Though I was the stronger, he held me
fast by some subtle trick of wrestlers’ art that,
without injuring, rendered me as helpless as a
child.</p>

<p>“Not yet!” he muttered, “not yet, brother!”</p>

<p>Unable to free myself, I was forced to stand
and glare impotently through the whirling rain
at the terrible massacre. At the beginning of the
fight the <i>hatamotos</i> had numbered a fourth more
than the assailants. Now they were already less
than equal in number. With merciless swiftness,
the <i>ronins</i> struck out in terrific blows that split
heads to the chin and hewed off arms and legs
and ripped open bodies with hideous slashes.</p>

<p>Vainly the brave <i>hatamotos</i> parried and slashed
back at their foes with strokes no less powerful
and often more skilful. For the most part, their
blows served only to slice the false covering from
the helmets of the <i>ronins</i> or nick the steel and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
brass under the masking cloaks. But every
stroke of the <i>ronin</i> blades that reached its mark
meant a ghastly wound.</p>

<p>Yet the <i>hatamotos</i> were not the only ones that
fell in the bloody shambles. Twice I saw <i>ronins</i>
go down under blows that split clean through their
steel helmets; others were bitten deep by blades
that slashed through the firmest chain mail; while
more lost a foot or a hand from the lightning
strokes of the Shogun’s swordsmen. But gloriously
as the <i>hatamotos</i> fought, the <i>ronins</i> were no less
brave and little less skilful, and the armor gave
them an advantage impossible to overcome.</p>

<p>Never had I dreamt of such terrific fighting.
In as many seconds a dozen of the guard were
lying mutilated under the iron-shod sandals of the
<i>ronins</i>. Every <i>hatamoto</i> near the <i>norimon</i> of the
Princess and all but three or four of those in
the rear were slain. One of the bearers of the
rearmost <i>norimon</i> caught up a sword and struck
out manfully. Back flashed a blow that split
him to the middle. His fellow-bearers, who so
far had stood as though paralyzed by fright, fled
past us shrieking.</p>

<p>But not one of the proud <i>hatamotos</i> sought to
escape. Shouting fierce imprecations, the last of
the rearguard parried and struck, each as long
as he could stand,&mdash;without giving back an inch
before the merciless attack of their murderers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
The six members of the vanguard still left, burst
through the ring of <i>ronins</i> that was closing about
them, and fought their way back towards the
<i>norimon</i> of the Princess, whose bearers were being
forced by threatening blades to swing about to
the narrow side street.</p>

<p>“Now!” shouted Yoritomo, as the <i>ronins</i> again
closed around the vanguard. He freed me and
leaped away up the street, flourishing his sword
and yelling, “<i>Owari!</i> <i>Owari!</i>”</p>

<p>I rushed after him, blood-mad with the sight of
the fighting and slaughter, and utterly lost to
all sense of danger in my fury at the ferocious
treachery of the assassins.</p>

<p>“Avast!” I roared in English, “avast, you devils!”</p>

<p>For answer, the head of the last rear-guardsman
came rolling towards us along the wet pavement.
Close after it a pair of <i>ronins</i> sprang to meet and
slash down the audacious priests. Out lunged
Yoritomo’s sword, and the foremost murderer
fell headlong, stabbed through the throat. The
second slashed at my head. But the stroke
glanced harmlessly down my parrying blade, and
before the fellow could recover guard, I drove my
point into one of his glaring eyes.</p>

<p>As my man fell across Yoritomo’s, three others
came running at us with the ferocity of tigers.
We sprang to meet them half-way. One, fortunately,
was slightly outdistanced by his fellows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
The swords of the two leaders clashed against
ours in fierce, eager strokes. A blow, barely
warded, struck off my hat and exposed fully to
the gaze of my opponent my distended blue eyes.
A look of horror flashed across his vengeful face.
Doubtless he thought me a demon. For the
barest fraction of a second he faltered&mdash;it was
enough for me. Before his gaping mouth could
snap shut, he fell to my lunge.</p>

<p>I wheeled to meet the third man, who, as Yoritomo
parried with the second for an opening, had
sprung around for a treacherous side slash.
My outstretched blade met but failed to check
entirely the blow, which fell across the back of
Yoritomo’s right shoulder. Meeting my gaze,
the ronin faltered as had his mate, and the result
was as fatal to him. How seriously Yoritomo
had been wounded I could not tell. I doubt if
he was aware he had been struck. His lunge
followed after mine, flash upon flash.</p>

<p>We darted forward, leaving five of the murderous
band already accounted for. Four more were
intent upon driving the bearers of Azai’s <i>norimon</i>
on across into the side street. All the others were
crowding around the few survivors of the vanguard
in furious attack. Only supreme masters of
Japanese swordcraft could have so long withstood
the tremendous blows of the assassins throughout
this atrocious massacre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
To fling ourselves into the midst of the deadly
struggle was sheer madness&mdash;but it was a glorious
madness. Having a moment’s start of my friend,
I dashed ahead, past the rearmost <i>norimon</i>, from
which the younger lady-in-waiting was frantically
struggling to free herself. The <i>norimon</i> of the princess
had been swung about, and its reluctant bearers
were being forced into a trot by prodding dirks.</p>

<p>Shouting a command for the bearers to halt,
I ran upon the <i>ronins</i> at the rear, who were directly
before me. Until this moment they had been
too intent upon driving the bearers to perceive
us. The sight of their fallen comrades and the
possibility of a check in their plans seemed to
madden them. They rushed to meet me with a
silent rage that flamed into wildest fury at sight
of my <i>tojin</i> eyes.</p>

<p>“Demon! Kill! kill!” they yelled, and their
strokes flashed out at me so swift and strong that
I was beaten back a full two yards, and saved
myself from the whistling blades only by the
nimblest of footwork and parrying.</p>

<p>In a moment, though none too soon, Yoritomo
sprang to my side and crippled one of the grinning
fiends with a leg cut. This man must have been
the leader of the band, for as he and his mate
fell to our thrusts, the pair at the head of the <i>norimon</i>
checked their charge upon us, and shouted
loudly to their fellows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
Only three of the <i>hatamotos</i> now stood in the
merciless circle of swords, and but one of their
assailants had fallen. At the cry for help, the
greater number of the <i>ronins</i> wheeled about and
charged upon us, with the rain splashing upon
their downbent helmet brims.</p>

<p>“Shoot!” gasped Yoritomo, bending over to
lean upon his sword. “My arm weakens!&mdash;Shoot!”</p>

<p>Already my right hand was thrusting into my
bosom. As I drew out one of the revolvers and
cocked it, I stepped forward and to the left, that I
might have the <i>norimon</i> between me and the charging
<i>ronins</i>. At the same moment the young
<i>samurai</i> woman from the rear <i>norimon</i> darted
between the bearers and stood up across from me,
facing the <i>ronins</i>, with upraised dirk. She could
not have hoped to stop the ruffians for an instant,
but she thought they meant to injure her mistress,
and so was offering her own bosom first to the
murderous blades.</p>

<p>The sight of such absolute courage and devotion
steadied my twitching hand. I raised my revolver,
and fired as rapidly as I could work hammer and
trigger. The <i>ronins</i> were too close for me to
miss even through the swirl of wind and rain. I
risked no glancing of balls from mailed breasts,
but aimed at the devilish faces below their broad
helmet brims. To shoot wide of such large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
marks within a distance of ten paces and less
would have been difficult, and a man shot from
the front anywhere between mouth and brows
never requires a second ball. Down went the foremost
<i>ronins</i>, sprawling backwards in the flooded
roadway, one at every shot.</p>

<p>To these mediæval warriors, acquainted only
with antique matchlocks and Tower muskets,
the mysterious appearance and rapid fire of my
revolver must have been even more appalling
than the death of their leaders. Before I could
snatch out my second pistol, every man of them
still on his feet fled towards the narrow cross
street, shrieking that I was the <i>daimio</i> of demons.
To aid their flight, I sent after them a leaden
message that glanced from the helmet of the rearmost
man, yet sent him staggering for a dozen
yards.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII&mdash;<span class="smcap">Escort to the Princess</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap1"><span class="smcap1">A</span> gust whirled the smoke of the shot
into my face. As I paused with
half-raised pistol, waiting for the
puff to sweep aside, I heard the
<i>samurai</i> lady calling cheerfully to
her mistress, “My Princess! august lady! Fear
nothing. The <i>ronins</i> have fled!”</p>

<p>I gazed about at the <i>norimon</i>. On the far side
the brave girl was kneeling in her drenched silks,
intent upon reassuring the occupant of the palanquin
with word and smile. But the Princess
had turned to the window on my side, and, heedless
of the rain, was peering out at me through
the parted bamboo curtain with even more awe and
wonder in her dusky eyes than when she saw me
in the temple.</p>

<p>My features, flushed and distorted as they were
from the rage of battle and bloodshed, and fully
exposed to view by the loss of my hat, must have
appeared to her both <i>outré</i> and terrifying. Yet
she was aware that I had helped to save her from
the <i>ronins</i>. The <i>samurai</i> girl was exclaiming the
fact through the other window. I bent toward
her with a reassuring smile, but before I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
speak, Yoritomo shouted to the bearers, “About,
men! To the palace!”</p>

<p>The <i>samurai</i> girl sprang up as the willing bearers
swung around over the bodies of the dead and
wounded. The two <i>hatamotos</i> who alone had
lived to witness the flight of the <i>ronins</i> came
staggering to meet the litter, the blood of their
many wounds dripping with the rain from their
tattered coats. One of them I recognized as
Yuki the captain. Past the wounded men darted
the aged <i>samurai</i> woman of the foremost <i>norimon</i>,
whose bearers had fled at the beginning of the
attack, and who had only just contrived to squeeze
from her narrow box.</p>

<p>I drew a deep breath, and stared around at
the bloody scene through the lessening rain, in
sudden bewilderment. To have witnessed the
butchery of all those brave <i>hatamotos</i>, to have had
so large a part in the defeat and rout of their
murderers, to have met again the soft gaze of
the Shogun’s daughter, all within little more than
two minutes&mdash;small wonder I stood dazed! It
was my first fight, the first time I had ever met
and struck down men in mortal combat.</p>

<p>One of the wounded <i>ronins</i> had dragged himself
a little aside and, crouched on knees and heels,
was bending forward with the point of his dirk at
his bared left loin. I caught at Yoritomo’s arm
to point out the man, but before he could turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
to look, the <i>ronin</i> had stabbed himself and was
drawing the blade across his middle with a horrible
deliberateness. After the cross stroke there followed
an upward cut. The suicide swayed forward
in silent agony, yet still had strength and resolution
to draw out the blade and plunge it through his
neck.</p>

<p>“<i>Hara-kiri!</i>” murmured Yoritomo, in a tone
of deepest respect. “He has saved his family from
disgrace and punishment. See! There are two
others who would do the same.”</p>

<p>One had been enough for me. I turned, shuddering,
to pick my way over the water-and-blood-soaked
bodies of the dead, in the wake of the
slowly advancing <i>norimon</i>. The rain-squall was
blowing away as swiftly as it had dashed upon us.</p>

<p>With the passing of the last shower, a burst of
golden light from the low western sun flooded
over the roof of the <i>yashiki</i> on our left. At the
same moment I heard the sound of rushing iron-shod
feet. As I flung up my downbent head the
sun-rays glittered on the wet silks and bared steel
of a band of <i>samurais</i> that came charging out of
the street on the right.</p>

<p>“Keiki!” cried Yoritomo, and clapping his
hat upon my head, he darted forward to thrust
a roll of writing through the window of the
<i>norimon</i>, into the lap of the Princess.</p>

<p>With my second revolver held loose under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
edge of my robe, I sprang after him to the side
of the <i>norimon</i>, as the Mito men swarmed out and
closed about the crippled cortege. The first
glance had shown them the failure of their diabolical
plot. Utterly disconcerted and bewildered
by the defeat of the <i>ronins</i>, they ran about like
wolves that have overshot the trail of their quarry.
The two wounded <i>hatamotos</i> sought to wave them
aside, but so many blocked the way that our
party was forced to halt.</p>

<p>The thought flashed upon me that they might
butcher every one of us except the Princess, and
then claim all the credit of the rescue. This I
am certain would have been the course of action
of the more hot-blooded among them, had not
the older men bethought themselves that they
could not silence the Shogun’s daughter. To
accomplish the object of their plot, they must
bring her safe to her father.</p>

<p>In the midst of their flurry and confusion, a
<i>norimon</i> came swaying around the corner of the
side street at a most unlordly speed. Before it
the excited <i>samurais</i> parted their ranks, and the
bearers trotted across as if to range alongside the
<i>norimon</i> of the Princess. Yoritomo sprang before
them with barring sword.</p>

<p>“Stand!” he commanded.</p>

<p>The bearers halted at the word, but the <i>samurais</i>
burst into angry yells, and turned to rush upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
the audacious priest who had dared to oppose
the advance of their lord. A glance around in
search for some way of escape showed me the
windows of the <i>yashikis</i> jammed with the heads
of out-peering women and the main street full
of running <i>hatamotos</i> and <i>samurais</i>. My pistol
shots had been heard above the uproar of the
squall.</p>

<p>Regardless of the swiftly gathering crowd,
Keiki’s men pressed upon Yoritomo, with upraised
swords. I drew my revolver and stepped forward
beside him, certain that the end had come. I
could not hope to overawe so large a band with
a few shots. Without doubt we would have been
overwhelmed and cut down within the next
quarter-minute, had not their master called upon
our menacing opponents to fall back.</p>

<p>The bearers of the black <i>norimon</i> set down their
burden, and the nearest <i>samurais</i> sprang to remove
the top. The silk-clad aristocrat who arose from
the depths of the box-like palanquin was younger
and even handsomer than Yoritomo, but his eyes,
between their excessively narrow lids, had a
shiftiness that reminded me of the treacherous
Malays.</p>

<p>Yoritomo bowed low to him in mock politeness.</p>

<p>“Ten thousand years to the heir of Hitotsubashi!”
he said. “Had Keiki Sama come sooner,
he might have aided the progress of the Shogun’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
daughter, instead of blocking the passage of the
august lady.”</p>

<p>“Seize that false priest!” commanded Keiki,
stung beyond self-control.</p>

<p>But before the eager <i>samurais</i> could spring in
upon him, Yoritomo flung the priest robe from
his shoulders, and exposed to view the Tokugawa
crests upon his silk <i>haori</i>. Angry as were the
Mito men, they stopped short at that insignia
of the ruling family.</p>

<p>Again Yoritomo bowed to Keiki and spoke
with biting sarcasm: “The son of Owari dono
greets the son of Mito dono. It may be possible
that Keiki Sama is disappointed at having arrived
too late to share in the slaying of certain <i>ronins</i>.
Wounds have been received by those who defended
the august lady, but if the heir of Hitotsubashi
will condescend to soil his honorable feet, proposal
is made that he exhibit his wide-famed skill as
a swordsman.”</p>

<p>For a moment I feared that the fiery young
lord would snap at the ironical challenge. He
flushed a dusky red beneath his olive skin and glared
at my friend with a malignancy that caused me to
raise and aim my revolver with an instinctive
movement such as might have followed the sudden
uprearing of a venomous snake. Had Keiki so
much as signed to his retainers, he himself would
have been the first to die. But a gray-bearded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
counsellor was murmuring quick words into the ear
of his master. Keiki’s hate-distorted features relaxed
to the blank, inscrutable calmness of Yoritomo’s.</p>

<p>“The heir of Hitotsubashi does not pollute
himself by crossing swords with common street
brawlers,” he answered.</p>

<p>Yoritomo smiled suavely. “Keiki Sama need
not fear to pollute his sword. Such of the brawlers
as have not fled are all slain. Fortunate is the
evil-doer who dies beneath another’s sword or
finds opportunity to commit <i>hara-kiri</i>. The stern
torturers rack the limbs of criminals until they
confess all the foul plans of themselves and their
accomplices.”</p>

<p>Unable to face my friend’s challenging glance,
Keiki turned to the wounded captain of Azai’s
guard. “Yuki,” he called, “lead on again! My
cortege is at the service of the Shogun’s daughter,
to escort her safe to the inner castle.”</p>

<p>The younger <i>samurai</i> lady, who had knelt
beside the <i>norimon</i> of the Princess, whispered
across to the older lady. She in turn bowed and
whispered to Yuki. Though tottering from his
wounds, the <i>hatamoto</i> captain straightened and
replied to Keiki in a tone of haughty command:
“Stand aside with your men, lord. The daughter
of the Tycoon is satisfied with the escort of the
two priest-clad champions who, single-handed,
destroyed the evil <i>ronins</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
At this the newly arrived <i>hatamotos</i> came
shouldering their way in among the Mito men
with scant ceremony, and Keiki hastened to give
the signal for his retainers to fall back. Again the
bearers of the Princess started forward, with the
two wounded <i>hatamotos</i> in the lead, each supported
between a pair of his fellow-retainers.
The others stationed themselves behind, to act
as rearguard. Yoritomo sheathed his sword, and
placed himself before the old <i>samurai</i> lady, on
the right side of the <i>norimon</i>. Following his
example, I thrust my sword and revolver inside
my robe, and stationed myself on the left of the
<i>norimon</i>, in front of the <i>samurai</i> girl.</p>

<p>As we advanced through the crowd of curious
onlookers, I glanced about at the baffled Mito
men, who were attempting to “save the face”
of their lord by forming about his <i>norimon</i> in
the usual stately cortege. Chancing to catch
the eager gaze of the <i>samurai</i> girl, I smiled and
nodded. Encouraged by my condescension to
venture a like breach of etiquette, she bowed low,
and murmured, with a soft laugh: “August lord!
pardon the rudeness of Setsu!”</p>

<p>“O Setsu San is free to speak,” I said.</p>

<p>“Ten thousand years of happy life to my lord!”
she murmured. “Again pardon the inexcusable
rudeness,&mdash;but the awesome face of my lord
has been seen by august eyes. Should report be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
made that my lord is to be numbered among the
<i>kami</i>?&mdash;or is he a <i>tojin sama</i>?”</p>

<p>“A <i>daimio</i> of the <i>tojin</i>, come to aid Dai Nippon
with sword and counsel,” I answered.</p>

<p>She bowed low, with a gentle insucking of breath,
and fell silent. But as I sauntered along beside
the slowly moving <i>norimon</i>, I caught glimpses
of a pair of soft black eyes peering at me through
the fringe of the window curtain. There could
be no doubt that the Shogun’s daughter was studying
such of my face as showed below the hat brim.
The thought that she might be seeking to accustom
herself to the “demon” eyes of the <i>tojin</i> set me
aglow with blissful anticipations. But my amorous
fancies quickly gave place to hot shame
at the remembrance that the gentle little princess
was the betrothed of my friend.</p>

<p>Our slow advance at last brought us up on the
causeway, across the lake-like moat from the
cyclopean wall and gate. The passage had been
made through the midst of a multitude, drawn in
rapidly increasing numbers by wild rumors of
the fight. The causeway swarmed with hundreds
of <i>samurais</i>, who stared at Yoritomo and myself
in respectful silence.</p>

<p>A company of the <i>hatamotos</i> in charge of the
great gate had advanced across the bridge to
meet the Princess. Near the foot of the bridge
Yoritomo signed me to stop. We stepped back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
while the <i>norimon</i> and those who followed it
passed on between.</p>

<p>A venerable <i>samurai</i> wearing the circled cross
of Satsuma saluted Yoritomo and pointed westward
to the gate of one of the nearer <i>yashikis</i>.</p>

<p>“Shimadzu Satsuma-no-kami sends greeting to
Yoritomo Sama, the heroic son of Owari dono,
and to his heroic companion!” he said. “Will
they honor the house of Shimadzu by entering
and refreshing themselves?”</p>

<p>“Return our greetings and thanks to the Daimio
of Satsuma,” replied Yoritomo. “We hope soon
to visit Shimadzu Sama, but now we have come
from a long journey, and must hasten to salute
my father.”</p>

<p>“The son of Owari dono is wounded,” suggested
the <i>samurai</i>.</p>

<p>“A wound received in a good cause bears no
sting,” replied my friend with a Confucian sententiousness
that drew an appreciative murmur
from the crowd. He waved aside the old
<i>samurai</i> with a courteous gesture, and crossed
to me. “Come, brother, we must be on our way.
The sun is low, and we have no lanterns.”</p>

<p>The <i>samurai</i> again hastened around before him
and bent low. “Fearing that Yoritomo Sama
might be unable to linger for a call, my lord took
the liberty to send <i>norimons</i> for the conveyance
of the son of Owari dono and his companion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
“The gracious offer of Shimadzu, the Daimio
of Satsuma, is accepted with grateful thanks,”
responded Yoritomo.</p>

<p>At a sign from the <i>samurai</i>, two red-lacquered
<i>norimons</i> were borne forward through the crowd,
and their doors opened for us to enter. Calling
to mind Yoritomo’s instructions I slipped off my
sandals and squeezed into one of the narrow boxes.
Once inside, I crouched down on knees and heels
in quite the correct manner, though I caught a
murmur of politely smothered surprise at my
failure to remove my hat.</p>

<p>A half-minute later our palanquins were swinging
westward along the walled edge of the moat,
an escort of Satsuma <i>samurais</i> in van and rear,
and the old leader in attendance beside Yoritomo’s
<i>norimon</i>.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Prince of Owari</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">Our</span> trip through the <i>daimio</i> quarter
must have covered two miles and
more. Though closely cramped in
my elegant box, I managed by
stooping over to peer out through
the bamboo fringe of the windows. For some
time we had on our left the walls of large <i>yashikis</i>
and on our right the beautiful lotus-covered moat-lake,
with the lofty rampart of the citadel across.
The sun sank beneath the horizon as we turned
westward down a wide thoroughfare.</p>

<p>Presently we turned again, and passed zigzag
from one street to another between silent <i>yashikis</i>.
The buildings were lighted only by quaint street
lanterns hung beside their heavy gateways and
by the dim glow of candles through the white
paper screens of the windows. The few people
passing along these aristocratic streets were provided
against the gathering darkness by cylindrical
lanterns marked with the crests of various <i>daimios</i>.</p>

<p>At last we came to one of the bastioned gateways
of the outer moat, and, after a brief parley with
the guard, passed through and out across the
bridge. Shortly beyond, our escort halted before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
a grand double-roofed gateway. We had arrived
at the main entrance to the largest of the <i>yashikis</i>
belonging to the Prince of Owari.</p>

<p>While our bearers carried us across the stone
bridge of the moat-ditch into the lighted space
before the huge copper-faced gates, the old <i>samurai</i>
leader announced us to the warden or captain
of the gate. Almost instantly the ponderous
leaves of the gate swung open before us, and a
dozen Owari <i>samurais</i> hastened out to open the
<i>norimons</i> and salute their occupants.</p>

<p>Yoritomo met their smiles and kowtowings and
noisy insuckings of breath with an austere dignity
that I took pains to imitate. But to my surprise,
he accepted a pair of the lacquered clogs that were
brought for us, and proceeded to leave his <i>norimon</i>.
Catching my look, he explained in English: “I
am yet to be made heir, and as a younger son I
lack the rank required of one permitted to ride
in through the gateway.”</p>

<p>“Your rank is known,” I replied. “Mine is
yet to be established. I will make a start here
and now. You know that in my country there
is no man of better blood than myself. I will
not enter your father’s gateway except in my
<i>norimon</i>.”</p>

<p>“You are right. The point is shrewdly taken,” he
assented, and he spoke gravely to the gate warden.</p>

<p>The retainer accepted the statement of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
master’s son without a trace of hesitancy, and I
was carried in beneath the carved and lacquered
crossbeams of the gateway with Yoritomo walking
beside my <i>norimon</i>. The iron-shod sandals
of <i>samurais</i> and bearers clattered on the stone
flags of the broad courtyard within the gate.</p>

<p>Crossing this court, we passed up a slope and
through an ornamental fence, into a second court
before the mansion of the prince. Wings and high
hedges flanked the main building in such manner
that we could have seen nothing of the <i>yashiki</i>
gardens even had the day still lingered. I was,
however, more than satisfied by the fairy-like
vision of the palace. Though the building was
of only one story, the white-tiled roof flung up
its twisted gables against the blue-black sky with
an effect of airy height, while the rows of lanterns,
hung to the outcurving eaves, shed their soft
glow over the artistic balustrades and polished
planking of verandas wider than those of Zozoji.</p>

<p>In the centre of the façade was a grand portico
of <i>keyaki</i> wood, supported by carved beams and
pillars lacquered in vivid colors. Young pages
came out to salute us and spread mats for us to
step upon. I emerged from my <i>norimon</i>. Yoritomo
returned our thanks to the old <i>samurai</i> for
the courtesy of Satsuma, and stepped from his
clogs onto the mats beside me as the bearers and
escort turned back to the gate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
An elderly chamberlain in richest costume
appeared from within and kowtowed before us.
Mindful of my lessons in etiquette, I drew out
my sheathed sword and handed it to the official as
he rose. He took the priceless weapon reverently
and raised it to his forehead before giving it into
the keeping of one of the pages. Yoritomo
handed his own sword to a second page, and
addressed the chamberlain curtly: “Let my august
father be informed of our arrival, Fujimaro.”</p>

<p>“By what name shall I announce my lord’s
companion?” asked the chamberlain.</p>

<p>“Announce my friend as one entitled to sit
at the left hand of the Prince of Owari.”</p>

<p>Fujimaro bowed us into the keeping of a second
chamberlain, and slipped noiselessly away over
the white mats. The newcomer kowtowed, and,
at a word from Yoritomo, conducted us in through
a vestibule lined with halberds, lances, archers’
equipage, armor, and battle-axes, to a dim-lit
passage. The pages with our swords followed at
a respectful distance.</p>

<p>Two or three turns brought us to the brightly
illuminated dressing-room of a bath. As we entered
several attendants saluted and began waiting
on us, rising from their knees only when necessary.
When my hat was removed, one man gave a
gasp of amazement. Otherwise all preserved their
bland smiles throughout my disrobing, too well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
trained to venture any comments upon my “snow
white” skin.</p>

<p>But etiquette did not prevent them from uttering
soft exclamations of grief and pity when the
removal of Yoritomo’s dress disclosed a deep
cut across his shoulder blade. Though no longer
bleeding, the wound gaped open to the bone.
Yet with Spartan fortitude Yoritomo silenced
their cries and ordered them to proceed with me.
When, in turn, he had received his cold rub and
hot immersion, he at last permitted the chamberlain
to bind up the wound with moistened strips
of the tough Japanese paper.</p>

<p>Blind shampooers reinvigorated our muscles with
their skilful rubbing; other attendants shaved us,
dressed our hair, and attired us in gorgeous ceremonial
costume, including white silk socks and
the gauze-winged jackets called <i>kamishimos</i>. Last
of all our dirks were thrust into our girdles and
my revolvers and cartridges placed on a red
lacquer tray to be carried after us with our swords.</p>

<p>Fujimaro appeared to conduct us into the
presence of the Prince. We followed him through
well-lighted corridors, flanked by rooms varying
in size but all alike in their silk-bordered mats,
the beautiful pictures on their lacquer-rimmed
wall-screens, and the artistic fretwork in the space
between the lintel-beams and the ceiling. Throughout
the palace the woodwork was in natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
finish, without paint or varnish, yet polished
until the exquisitely grained surface shimmered
like watered silk.</p>

<p>At the anteroom of the <i>daimio’s</i> hall of audience
two more chamberlains kowtowed and ushered
us forward. At the head of the room there was
an impressive pause. The chamberlains could
not have looked more solemn had they been
ushering us into the presence of the Shogun himself.
The screens before us drew noiselessly aside and
disclosed a chamber somewhat larger than the
anteroom and a slight step higher.</p>

<p>The chamberlains kowtowed at the threshold
and crept forward on their knees. We followed,
erect. To our left, midway up the room, knelt
six dignified <i>samurai</i> counsellors. The Daimio
awaited us, seated Turk fashion upon a low dais
before a lacquer-walled <i>tokonoma</i>. So far as I
could judge of his figure within the loose robes,
he was tall and slender. He wore a small beard
and mustache whose snowy whiteness contrasted
with his tall black bag-like cap of cobwebby tissue.
His long face had a stern and saturnine expression
and he bore himself with austere stateliness.</p>

<p>As the chamberlains neared the dais, they
kowtowed and drew to one side. We advanced
and knelt, and Yoritomo kowtowed. Resolved
to maintain equality with the Prince, I went no
further than a low bow. As I straightened, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
Prince gazed keenly into my blue eyes, and after
a moment’s pause returned my bow. I was
received as a <i>daimio</i> of the first class!</p>

<p>The kneeling chamberlains waved me to the
cushion on the left of the Prince and Yoritomo
to the cushion on his right. Our swordbearers
slid around to the <i>tokonoma</i> and placed our swords
upon the rack of honor below the Prince’s glittering
gold-mounted helmet and armor. At a sign
from the Prince, the page bearing my revolvers
and cartridges set his tray before us.</p>

<p>The solemn silence which had prevailed since
our entrance continued while attendants glided
in with sweetmeats and a toy-like tea service
of egg-shell china. When we had been served,
the Daimio signed all the retainers except his
counsellors to withdraw, and broke the silence
by politely inquiring my name, age, and family.</p>

<p>“My father’s guest is Adamisu Woroto Sama,”
answered Yoritomo for me. “He is a <i>daimio</i>
of the great <i>tojin</i> people whose land is called
America. His age is the same as my own. In
all America there is no family of higher blood
than the family of my friend and benefactor.
He held honorable rank under the Government
of America, but laid aside office, and has come
with me to aid Dai Nippon.”</p>

<p>The Prince looked across to the group of counsellors,
and the aged <i>karo</i>, or chief counsellor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
responded to the wordless inquiry without moving.</p>

<p>“My lord, in the Legacy of Iyeyasu it is forbidden
to harbor a <i>tojin</i>. According to the
ancient edict, all Christians shall be imprisoned
in the common jail.”</p>

<p>“August Prince and father,” said Yoritomo,
“the Legacy of Iyeyasu also forbids that any man
shall leave the shores of Nippon, under penalty
of crucifixion. Your son has travelled beyond the
shores of Nippon; he has traversed the five continents,
and proved the truth of the Dutch learning
by sailing around the vast circuit of the world.”</p>

<p>“My lord,” said the <i>karo</i>, “the wording of the
edict is explicit. Death is decreed against whomsoever
shall presume to intercede for the life of
a man returned from beyond the seas. Men of
low class&mdash;fishermen&mdash;have been received back
from <i>tojin</i> ships and forgiven their unintended
crime. But according to his own words, Yoritomo
Sama left the shore of Nippon with intent to
contravene the ancient edict by bringing back
the knowledge of the <i>tojins</i>. My lord, the enforcement
of the laws has been lax in recent years;
there has been much blinking at the study of the
Dutch learning. Yet the laws stand ready for
enforcement against my lord and Yoritomo Sama
and the honorable guest, should enemies of my
lord make demand upon Midzuano Echizen-no-kami,
chief of the Elder Council.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
“A petition for a hearing has already gone
to the Household in the <i>norimon</i> of the Princess
Azai,” replied Yoritomo, and without naming
Kohana, he told succinctly how we had discovered
and defeated the Mito plot.</p>

<p>The Daimio and his counsellors listened throughout
with an impassiveness of manner which I
should have mistaken for indifference had I not
been near enough to see the glow in the jet
eyes of the Prince. At the end of the account
the great man murmured his comments in a voice
that vibrated with suppressed exultance:</p>

<p>“In all that you have done, my son, I see the
guidance of the gods and of the spirits of our
forefathers. The Mito men walk with faces over
their shoulders, looking to the past, and with
ears closed against all reports of the disasters
brought upon the Chinese by a like frog-in-the-well
policy. The true cause of the Mikado owes
much to your service and the service of this noble
<i>tojin sama</i>.”</p>

<p>“I have broken the law; I have brought danger
upon the House of Owari,” said Yoritomo. “I
alone should receive punishment, and not my
family. Shall it be <i>hara-kiri</i>, or shall I strip off
the Tokugawa crest, and as a <i>ronin</i> seek to accomplish
my mission, aided only by my <i>tojin</i> brother?”</p>

<p>His father looked across at the counsellors,
and the old <i>karo</i> responded without a moment’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
hesitancy: “Yoritomo Sama has in truth been
guided by the ancestral spirits of Owari. Chief
and clan should stand or fall in the support of
the heir of Owari.”</p>

<p>“Heir?” murmured Yoritomo. “Such, then,
is the truth!”</p>

<p>“Trusted men have been making secret search
for you throughout Nippon,” answered the Prince.
“For a month your elder brother has lain sick
beyond hope of recovery. His son is yet a child.
The strong man has come to succeed the sick
heir. To-morrow the death of your brother will
be announced.”</p>

<p>To give way to grief in the presence of a superior
is a most serious breach of Japanese etiquette.
The graver the grief or pain, the more pronounced
the smile of the sufferer. Yoritomo uttered a
soft laugh, and immediately turned the conversation
to a less painful subject.</p>

<p>“My lord,” he said, “I have told how Woroto
Sama received me aboard the black ship, and
how he proved himself the generous friend and
brother of the stranger. We believe the saying
that the spirits of our ancestors are ever about
us. Here is proof. Only a day past Woroto Sama
informed me that he is a descendant of Anjin
Sama.”</p>

<p>“Of Anjin Sama!” repeated the Prince, even
his austere reserve shaken by the statement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
I bowed to mask my curiosity. The news of
my ancestry could not be other than interesting
to any one acquainted with the romantic history
of Will Adams. But why should the announcement
to this Oriental prince create such a sensation?</p>

<p>He looked at me with a slight smile, and asked
his son: “Does Woroto Sama know?”</p>

<p>“He has yet to be informed, my lord.”</p>

<p>The Prince turned to his <i>karo</i>: “What is written
in the records of Owari regarding Anjin Sama,
the <i>tojin</i> counsellor of Minamoto Iyeyasu?”</p>

<p>“My lord, it is written that the fourth Daimio
of Owari took to wife the daughter of Satsuma-no-kami’s
brother Nagato. The wife of Nagato
was the daughter of Anjin Sama’s grandson.”</p>

<p>The saturnine face of the Prince relaxed in a
kindly smile, and Yoritomo bowed to me in grave
salute. “My brother now sees that it was immutable
Fate which drew us together in the bonds of
friendship. We are blood kinsmen.”</p>

<p>Accustomed as are we of the South to trace out
the ties of family through all its ramifications,
I was astonished at this recognition of cousinship
through so remote an ancestor, especially as I
knew the Japanese hold strictly to the male line.
But if the princely House of Owari was inclined
to receive me as a member of the clan and family,
it was not for me to repudiate the connection.</p>

<p>The Daimio spoke to the counsellors: “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
heir of the Prince of Owari is entitled to present
his memorial direct to the Shogun. See that
Yoritomo Sama is registered at Zozoji, in the place
of his elder brother, who is about to go from us.”</p>

<p>The counsellors kowtowed, and glided from the
room. Yoritomo addressed his father, with a
shade of anxiety beneath his smile: “My lord, I
cannot go before the Shogun during my time of
mourning. Yet the black ships may come any
day.”</p>

<p>“Prepare the memorial. I myself will present
it to the Shogun in private audience,” replied
the Prince.</p>

<p>One of the screens of the side wall slipped open,
and there entered a slender little old lady in dove-colored
silk. She was the first aged woman I had
yet seen in Japan whose features retained a share
of youthful beauty. Her face was as exquisitely
refined and almost as fair as that of the Shogun’s
daughter, while her teeth, owing either to greater
skill in the application or to better dye, were of
a glossy black not altogether unpleasing even to
my Occidental ideas of attractiveness.</p>

<p>Softly as a thistledown, she drifted across the
mats and knelt before Yoritomo, her lips parted in
a smile that went far beyond the demands of
etiquette. Tears of joy glided down her soft
cheeks, and in her eyes was a look of mother love
and devotion that made all clear to me. No less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
deep and overpowering was Yoritomo’s joy at
sight of his mother; his tears flowed quite as
freely. Yet there followed no outburst of caressing
words, no kisses and fond embraces. Weeping
and smiling in decorous quiet, they kowtowed
to one another and murmured formal words of
greeting.</p>

<p>In the midst Yoritomo composed himself to
introduce me as his friend and benefactor and a
distant kinsman of the family. She welcomed
me with exquisite courtesy. A <i>samurai</i> girl
appeared with a light refreshment of tea, and rice-cakes
covered with a sauce of red beans and
sugar. This the Princess served to us herself,
with a daintiness that would have drawn from me
more than one compliment had I not been aware
that my fine phrases would have been considered
an outrageous breach of etiquette.</p>

<p>When the little lady had withdrawn with her
assistant, the Prince unbent entirely from his
austere reserve, and in a most genial manner
showered upon me a hundred and one politely
personal inquiries as to my opinions and ideas.
Behind the mask of solemn state I found him a
gentleman as cordial as he was dignified, and as
kindly disposed as he was noble minded.</p>

<p>Returning to the fight with the <i>ronins</i>, he spoke
wonderingly of my audacious resort to firearms
within the bounds of Yedo, and insisted that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
should show him the action of my revolvers.
The weapons greatly pleased him, and he obtained
my promise to fire them the next day in one of
the archery walks of the <i>yashiki</i>.</p>

<p>After this, mindful of our need of rest, he touched
a small gong, and ordered the chamberlain Fujimaro,
who responded, to conduct me to apartments
occupying one of the wings of the palace.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV&mdash;<span class="smcap">Before the Shogun</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap1">For</span> several days I lived in strict seclusion.
A semi-detached wing of the palace,
surrounded by one of the most beautiful
of the landscape gardens within the
<i>yashiki</i>, had been set apart for my use.
All my wants were attended to by a faultlessly
polite corps of retainers and servants.</p>

<p>Fujimaro the chamberlain acted as my major-domo
and incidentally as my instructor in language
and etiquette. Much as I had derived both
consciously and unconsciously from my intimacy
with Yoritomo, I soon found that I had made
no more than a fair beginning in the intricacies
and niceties of one of the most difficult of languages
and of the most complicated of all existing codes
of etiquette, that of China not excepted.</p>

<p>My teacher proved to be invariably cordial and
interested, but no less invariably formal and precise
in his demeanor towards the <i>tojin daimio</i>.
The Prince, who came to walk with me in the
garden each day, was still more formal whenever
any of his retainers were present. At other times,
as when I showed him a little pistol practice
in the seclusion of a rockery, he unbent to me as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
to a peer, always faultlessly polite and dignified
yet flatteringly attentive to my conversation.</p>

<p>During this time I saw nothing of his wife, the
quaintly beautiful little lady Tokiwa Sama. The
family life of the Japanese nobility is extremely
private, even as regards relatives. Yoritomo found
time to pay me only one brief visit. He was
dressed in white, the Japanese mourning, and was
greatly worn by his labor in preparing his memorial
to the Shogun during the nights and his daytime
duties as chief mourner for his brother.</p>

<p>Japanese etiquette does not permit the official
mourning of parents for children. Upon Yoritomo
had fallen the sorrowful task of receiving the
family friends at the bier of his brother and of
attending to all the Buddhistic and Shinto funeral
rites. The day after our arrival the death of
his brother had been officially announced, and
the corpse, which had been embalmed in vermilion
for a month past, was mourned over for the
prescribed number of days before the interment
in one of the cemeteries at Shiba.</p>

<p>In the meantime my friend had completed a
summary of the knowledge he had acquired
regarding the outer world, and the new foreign
policy to which that knowledge pointed. He
was now writing the full report and memorial,
while his father, who had already smuggled the
summary into the Castle, was intriguing for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
permission to present the memorial direct to
the Shogun, unknown to Midzuano and the other
members of the Council of Elders.</p>

<p>As the Council was secretly pledged to the
Mito faction, it was necessary for us to obtain
an unprejudiced hearing from the Shogun. Delay
was dangerous, since at any moment Keiki might
invoke the ancient laws against us, or the inopportune
arrival of the American expedition might
checkmate our purpose by throwing the Government
into an irrevocably hostile attitude towards
the foreigners and ourselves.</p>

<p>Weary of inaction, I welcomed a message from
the Prince requesting me to join him on an informal
visit. Where we were to go was not stated,
but I accepted the invitation on the instant, and
asked no questions. My attendants dressed me
with utmost care, in rich though sober-colored
garments, and I noticed that a ceremonial winged
jacket, or <i>kamishimo</i>, of hemp-cloth was laid in
a lacquered case to be carried along.</p>

<p>When, shortly after midday, I was led through
the palace to the state portico, I found that the
Prince had already entered his <i>norimon</i>, and was
being borne away in the midst of his slow-moving
cortege. I stepped into my <i>norimon</i> and was borne
after him, Fujimaro and other officials walking
beside me. My led-horse and grooms, my two-sword
men, and the bearers of my state umbrella,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
hat, fan, and all the other ceremonial paraphernalia
of a <i>daimio</i>, were strung out before or
behind me.</p>

<p>Upon issuing from the <i>yashiki</i>, we did not cross
the outer moat at the nearest bridge, but skirted
southward along it to the Yotsuya Gate, which
opens into the great Kojimachi Street. Up Kojimachi
we swung at a pace far brisker than dignity
would have permitted had not the absence of
ceremonial standards indicated that we were
travelling <i>naibun</i>. The incognito of the Prince,
however, was no more than a conventional fiction,
since his cortege was immediately recognized
by every man in the throngs of <i>samurais</i> that
passed us within the official quarter.</p>

<p>Gazing out through my curtains, I caught the
politely veiled glances with which the two-sword
men regarded our cortege. The intensity of
party feeling among them was evident from the
total absence of indifference. There was not
one who failed to show indications of either warm
friendship or bitter hatred. This was no less true
of the helmetted riders we met. Some rode by
with the heads of their barbed and grotesquely
caparisoned horses curved high and the huge
slipper stirrups of the high-peaked saddles thrust
out aggressively. Others courteously swerved
to the far side of the street, and a few even dismounted,
despite our conventional incognito.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
A mile along the Kojimachi Street brought us
to the moat of the citadel. I expected our cortege
to turn to the right into the great causeway and
skirt the moat towards the Sakaruda Gate where
Yoritomo and I had parted from the cortege
of the Princess Azai. Instead, our escort led
straight on across the bridge that headed the
street. The thought flashed upon me that we
were about to enter the Shogun’s sacred enclosure
and call upon one of the high officials of the
Household.</p>

<p>On either side I looked down over the waters
of the beautiful moat, among whose blue-green
lotus pads swarmed ducks and geese, swans,
ibises, storks, and cranes. The outer bank rose
to the causeway in a steep grassy slope, set with
wide-spreading oaks and pines. Nearing the far
side, I studied at close view the granite blocks
of the citadel wall, many of which measured at
least four feet by sixteen. They were neatly
fitted together without mortar or iron cramps,
and showed no crevices or displacements from the
earthquakes of three centuries.</p>

<p>At the head of the bridge our cortege halted,
and Fujimaro informed me that I was to alight.
The Prince, as the head of one of the August
Three Families, was entitled to ride in through
this lesser gate, but no other <i>daimio</i> could be
accorded the privilege.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
“Very well,” I replied, determined to make a
test of the matter. “Let the Prince of Owari
proceed. I will wait his return here.”</p>

<p>“Impossible, my lord!” exclaimed the chamberlain.</p>

<p>“Then take me back to the <i>yashiki</i>,” I demanded.
“The Prince was pleased to receive me as a <i>daimio</i>
of rank equal to his own. I will enter the citadel
in the same manner that he enters, or not at all.”</p>

<p>This was a bold stand for a foreigner whose very
presence in Japan was against the ancient laws.
But my natural disposition to insist upon a correct
valuation of my dignity was backed by a careful
consideration of Japanese manners and customs.
As an American gentleman, I had the right to
rank myself as an equal to any one beneath the
ruler of the country. To accept a lower station
would result in humiliations that I was not disposed
to suffer, either from white men or brown.</p>

<p>There followed a prolonged conference between
the captain of the gate, the chamberlain, and
the Prince, during which Fujimaro twice came
back and begged me to change my determination.
I refused. The gate captain in turn refused to
admit the unknown occupant of the second <i>norimon</i>
other than on foot. The deadlock that followed
was broken by the appearance of a <i>hatamoto</i>
whom I at once recognized as the only member
of the Princess’s guard, except the leader, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
had survived the attack of the <i>ronins</i>. His dress
indicated that he had been promoted to the rank
of court chamberlain. He had come to conduct
us into the citadel, and at a word from him, the
obstinate gate captain yielded his will to mine.</p>

<p>We moved forward beneath the huge ancient
gateway into a small court between the lofty
bastions, and out at right angles, through an inner
gateway, into the marvellously beautiful gardens
of the Shogun. After winding about for half
a mile or more among hillocks and rockeries and
groves interspersed with kiosks and toy-like red-lacquered
temples, we came to the wall and moat
that surrounds the O Shiro.</p>

<p>Here the Prince and I left our <i>norimons</i>, and
walked over a slender high-arched bridge, accompanied
only by our chamberlains and the newly
made court chamberlain, who had ostentatiously
ushered us from the citadel gate. In compliance
with the request of the Prince, I walked behind
him as if lost in meditation, my head downbent
and eyes narrowed to a line.</p>

<p>At the far side of the bridge we passed between
the vigilant guards of the inner gateway, who,
however, seemed to detect nothing foreign in
my appearance. Beyond them we came into a
garden court, surrounded with high walls on three
sides and on the fourth with a wing of the palace.
There was no person to be seen either in the court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
or in the broad veranda of the palace wing, to
which we were conducted. Mounting a set of
movable lacquered steps, we crossed the veranda
to the threshold of a small waiting room.</p>

<p>When our clogs had been removed, the Prince
handed over not only his sword but his dirk as
well into the keeping of his chief attendant. The
act convinced me that we were about to be received
by the Shogun himself. It was absurd
to suppose that one of so exalted a rank as the
Prince would lay aside his dirk as well as his
sword for any personage in Yedo other than the
head of the Government. Fujimaro did not have
to ask twice for my swords. I handed them over
at the first word.</p>

<p>We entered and seated ourselves. The court
chamberlain kowtowed and withdrew, and our
attendants proceeded to slip on our winged jackets
and adjust our court caps. These were odd
black-lacquered affairs, not unlike inverted boats
in shape, and were tied on the crown of our heads
with cords passing under our chins. Our chamberlains
then handed us the ceremonial fans, and
withdrew to the lower end of the room.</p>

<p>After a short wait, the court official reappeared
and bowed to the Prince and myself. We rose
and followed him through a deserted corridor into
a large square room, where he signed us to kneel
on three mats below the cushions in front of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
<i>tokonoma</i>. He slipped out again by the way he
had entered, drawing shut the screen behind
him.</p>

<p>There followed a wait of ten or fifteen minutes,
during which I sought to quiet my apprehensions
as to the outcome of the audience with this mysterious
Oriental potentate, by studying the exquisite
cabinetwork and decorations of the room. I was
admiring the priceless <i>cloisonné</i> vase which shared
the floor of the <i>tokonoma</i> with a common water-worn
stone, when the Prince drew in his breath
with a soft sibilation, and kowtowed until his
forehead pressed the floor.</p>

<p>A quick glance showed me a gap between the
screens of the side wall, through which was entering
a portly, stern-faced, black-bearded man in yellow
<i>kimono</i> and black <i>haori</i>. In his girdle were
thrust a sword and dirk that glittered with gold
fretwork, but the bell-shaped cap, or hat, on the
crown of his head was of plain black lacquer.
The salute of the Prince was, however, quite
sufficient to convince me that we were in the
presence of the Shogun. I kowtowed beside my
companion.</p>

<p>We maintained our salute until the Shogun
had seated himself on the cushioned dais before
the <i>tokonoma</i> and commanded us to rise. As
we straightened and sat back on knees and heels,
I was astonished to perceive that we were alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
with this exclusive and jealously guarded ruler of
the most exclusive and jealously guarded empire
on earth. But I had heard too much about the
ways of Oriental potentates to doubt that palace
guards waited within instant call behind the frail
barrier of the wall screens.</p>

<p>“The petition of Yoritomo Sama for permission
to present a memorial through Owari dono has
been received and read,” he began in a clear,
colorless voice. “The summary of the intended
memorial of Yoritomo Sama has been received
but not read. The Legacy of Iyeyasu forbids
the reading of documents or letters that refer to
<i>tojin</i> countries.”</p>

<p>“The will of Minamoto Iyeyoshi is the delight
of his servants!” exclaimed the Prince, smiling
as though he had received a favor. “May inquiry
be made whether the Tycoon has laid the matter
before the Elder Council?”</p>

<p>If the Shogun was flattered by the adulatory
Chinese title, which properly belonged only to
the Mikado, there was nothing to indicate the
fact in his stern look. He replied curtly, “The
Council has not yet been consulted.”</p>

<p>Though so ungraciously stated, I divined that
this answer implied a point in our favor, and I
smiled quite as suavely as the Prince. The
Shogun turned his gloomy eyes upon me in a
fixed stare. As a matter of courtesy I was willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
to conform to the etiquette of the country, but
I was not inclined to cringe before any man.
No thought of insolence or bravado entered my
mind. The rank of this Oriental ruler entitled
him to my respect. I met his look with the calm
and steady gaze with which a gentleman regards
a new acquaintance.</p>

<p>The experiment was not lacking in danger.
Deference is the breath of life to the normal Oriental
potentate. But the pride of race and family is
hard to overcome, even though expediency counsel
a subservient attitude. I could not have humbled
myself had I desired.</p>

<p>The event proved that Minamoto Iyeyoshi
was far other than a typical tyrant. His dark
eyes lighted and he expressed his opinion of me
with royal conciseness: “The American <i>tojin</i>
is brave.”</p>

<p>I bowed in acknowledgment. “Your Highness
is pleased to be gracious! Permit me to speak
for one who is my friend,&mdash;a man who, for the
sake of his country, laid aside riches and rank,
and, at the risk of life and honor, crossed the seas
to search out the secrets of <i>tojin</i> power. Your
Highness, do the records of Nippon’s heroes tell
of any nobler deed of courage and devotion?”</p>

<p>“The Legacy of Iyeyasu may not be altered,”
he replied.</p>

<p>“Your Highness,” I said, “since the days of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
your august ancestor Iyeyasu Sama, Dai Nippon
has stood still among the nations of the earth
while all the <i>tojin</i> world has rolled forward. Even
China stirs from the sleep of cycles. The time
has come for the people of Nippon to learn that
the <i>tojins</i> are neither beasts nor demons nor
even barbarians. Your Highness, the son of the
wise Prince of Owari honored me with his friendship.
For the sake of that friendship I have come
with him to Nippon to advise the altering of the
laws of Iyeyasu.”</p>

<p>“A <i>tojin</i> counsellor in the Shogunate!”</p>

<p>“Your Highness may recall one precedent,”
I replied. “Iyeyasu Sama listened to the counsel
of Anjin Sama, my ancestor.”</p>

<p>The curiosity in the Shogun’s eyes deepened
without a trace of change in his impassive face.
He glanced inquiringly at my companion, who
responded in a tone of calm conviction: “Anjin
Sama, the favorite and most trusted counsellor
of our august ancestor, has returned in a new
birth to advise Minamoto Iyeyoshi regarding
the <i>tojin</i> peoples.”</p>

<p>“Does the <i>tojin</i> himself make claim that he is a
reincarnation of Anjin?” demanded the Shogun.</p>

<p>“No claim is made by myself, Your Highness,”
I answered. “I am not conscious that my soul
is the soul of Anjin. But I know that I am lineally
descended from Anjin through his English son,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
and Owari dono honors me with an acknowledgment
of kinship.”</p>

<p>The Prince bowed in confirmation.</p>

<p>Iyeyoshi’s face darkened. “Woroto is a believer
in the accursed sect!”</p>

<p>“Your Highness is mistaken,” I replied. “The
sect denounced by your laws is that body of
Christians which acknowledges the rule of the
Pope of Rome. There are many Christian sects
which reject the Pope.”</p>

<p>“All Christian sects seek to subvert filial piety
and the reverent worship of the august ancestors,
upon which rest the foundations of morality and
order.”</p>

<p>“Your Highness,” I ventured, “whatever may
be the foundations of order and morality, the life
of nations depends either upon the power to meet
force with force or the wisdom to avoid conflict.
For generations Dai Nippon has been safe owing
to her isolation from the lands beyond the wide seas.
But now the <i>tojin</i> peoples have attained to a power
inconceivable to one who has not seen. Their
warships cover the seas.”</p>

<p>“So also did the war junks of Kublai Khan,”
he rejoined.</p>

<p>“The fleet of Kublai Khan was destroyed off
the shores of Nippon by the great storm no less
than by the valor of Nippon’s <i>samurais</i>,” I
replied. “But the warships of the <i>tojins</i> move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
without sails against the greatest of typhoons,
and their cannon shoot far. Your Highness may
have heard of Chinese arrogance. The <i>tojins</i>
said, ‘Trade with us.’ The Chinese spat at them
and called them ‘foreign devils.’ The <i>tojins</i>
said, ‘Trade with us.’ They attacked the <i>tojins</i>.
The <i>tojin</i> warships came to them in anger.
Now they trade with the <i>tojins</i> in many open
ports. The <i>tojin</i> trade is a rising tide that is
sweeping its way around the world. Your Highness
knows that the Government of my country
is sending a very great official honorably to
request that the ports of Dai Nippon be unblocked
before the rising tide.”</p>

<p>“Earthquake waves have rolled up on our
coasts, destroying thousands. The waters have
ever receded, and Dai Nippon still stands.”</p>

<p>“The tide of <i>tojin</i> trade has never receded from
wherever it has flowed. <i>Tojin</i> power is far beyond
the knowledge of Your Highness. Do not judge
by the Dutch. They are now a very little people
in the <i>tojin</i> world. In the august name of Minamoto
Iyeyasu and in the name of Anjin Sama,
his counsellor, I ask Minamoto Iyeyoshi to receive
and ponder on the memorial of Yoritomo Sama.”</p>

<p>“The prayer of Woroto will be considered,”
replied the Shogun, and with this half concession,
he touched a small gong that stood beside him on
an elbow rest.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV&mdash;<span class="smcap">Requital</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">In</span> quick response to the signal, the chamberlain
who had conducted us to the palace entered
at the side of the room. Over his feet and a
yard behind trailed a grotesque prolongation
of his trouser legs that gave him the appearance
of walking on his knees. I supposed he had
been summoned to usher us out. But when he
crept forward on hands and knees and kowtowed,
the Shogun commanded harshly: “Look at the
<i>tojin</i>, Gengo. Report has been made that he committed
the crime of firing a gun within the bounds
of Yedo. Speak the truth.”</p>

<p>The chamberlain raised his head a little above
the floor, and stared across at me, his face gray
with fear beneath its set smile.</p>

<p>“Your Highness,” he murmured, “the truth
cannot be concealed. This is the <i>tojin</i> who, in
company with Yoritomo, son of Owari dono,
fired many shots from a little gun the like of which
has never before been seen in Yedo. Your Highness
knows that I had no share in the crime.
Yuki was captain of the cortege, and the responsibility&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
“Enough,” interrupted the Shogun. “Send in
Setsu.”</p>

<p>As the fellow crept from the room I stared after
him, astounded that fear could so debase one who
had outmatched by his skill and braveness the
armored <i>ronins</i>. He had stood unflinching before
the bloody swords that had cut down his comrades,
yet now, at the bare intimation that his lord was
displeased with me, crawled away without venturing
a word in favor of the <i>tojin</i> whose so-called
crime had saved him from death and his Princess
from the disgrace of capture.</p>

<p>I turned to the Prince, expecting him to burst
into warm protests against the injustice of the
Shogun’s attitude. He sat in placid silence, his
face wreathed in the polite smile of the Japanese
courtier. Yet I knew that he could not be indifferent.
Ruin to me would spell ruin to Yoritomo.
Determined not to be outdone in self-control,
I composed myself, and faced the Shogun with
the same forced smile of etiquette.</p>

<p>Iyeyoshi regarded me with an inscrutable look.
Though his features were as impassive as if cast
in golden bronze, I fancied a sinister mockery
behind the cold curiosity of his gaze. I felt as
a mouse must feel between the paws of the cat.
I had been so foolish as to leave my revolvers in
my apartments. I was absolutely in the power of
this gloomy-eyed ruler. I thought of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
hideous mediæval tortures still in practice in
this benighted land, and a cold sweat oozed out
upon my skin and chilled me. Yet I maintained
my courtier’s smile.</p>

<p>Noiselessly as a shadow a girl glided across the
room and prostrated herself before the Shogun.
It was the younger of the Princess Azai’s <i>samurai</i>
ladies. Iyeyoshi muttered a command. She
raised her head a few inches, and spoke rapidly,
but in tones so soft and low I could only conjecture
that she was giving a detailed account of the attack
and defeat of the <i>ronins</i>. Throughout the recital
the Shogun held to his cold scrutiny of my face.
I continued to smile.</p>

<p>At the end he signed her to go. In turning
about, she cast at me a glance of modest interest,
and I thought there was friendliness in her smile.
She glided out as noiselessly as she had entered.
There was a moment’s pause, and another girl
glided in to prostrate herself before the Shogun,&mdash;a
girl still more graceful and lissome, dressed in
crepes of gossamer texture. I stared in amazement,
my heart skipping a beat and then bounding with a
force that sent a flood of color into my face. The
girl was the Shogun’s daughter, the Princess Azai.</p>

<p>“Speak the full truth!” commanded the Shogun,
with the barest suggestion of tenderness beneath
his stern tone. “This is not the first time you
have seen the <i>tojin</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
“Your Highness,” she murmured, in a voice
as clear and musical as it was low, “the <i>tojin sama</i>
appeared before me first below the holy image of
Kwannon at Zozoji. I thought him a god or a
spirit. Again he appeared, in the midst of the
attack by the evil <i>ronins</i>, and then I knew him
to be a hero such as are told of in the ancient
writings.”</p>

<p>“The privilege of rulers is to honor heroes,”
said the Shogun, and he made a sign with his
fan.</p>

<p>Azai glided to the opening in the screens, and
returned with a tea tray of unvarnished cypress
wood, which she held above her white brow until
she had knelt to set it before her father. Having
served him, she glided across again, to return
with a tray and service of vermilion lacquer.
This she brought to the Prince, holding it not so
high as the first tray. Last of all she came to
serve me in precisely the same manner as my fellow-guest.
Tray and service and ceremonial were
identical. In other words, I was received by the
Shogun as a personage of rank equal to that of the
Prince of Owari.</p>

<p>But I gave scant thought to this triumph of
diplomacy when I looked down upon the quaint
coiffure and slender figure of the kowtowing
girl. As she straightened from the salute and,
still upon her knees, bent forward to offer me my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
tea and sweetmeats, her eyes rose to mine in a
timid glance. By good fortune I was able to
restrain my tongue. But I could not withhold
from my gaze the adoration which overwhelmed
me at this close view of her exquisite purity and
loveliness.</p>

<p>I had barely a glimpse of the soft brown-black
eyes, purpling with emotion. Then the lids
drooped their long lashes, and a scarlet blush
leaped into her ivory cheeks. Yet with consummate
grace and composure, she maintained her delicious
little smile of greeting, and served me without a
falter.</p>

<p>Her blush passed as swiftly as it had come,
but it left me stunned and dizzy with the realization
that I loved this divinely sweet and innocent
maiden,&mdash;the daughter of the proud ruler of
Nippon,&mdash;the promised bride of my true friend
Tomo. She was as far beyond my reach as the
silvery moon. What of that? Love does not
reason. Even in the midst of my shame at the
thought of my friend, I found myself unable to
resist the mad longing to win the lovely girl.</p>

<p>My infatuated gaze could not have escaped
the keen eyes of her father and the Prince. To
my surprise, instead of reproving me with word
or look, they sipped their tiny cups of tea as fast
as the little Princess could refill them, and
exchanged cryptic verses from the Chinese classics.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
The poetic contest continued until we had finished
our refreshment and Azai had withdrawn with her
trays.</p>

<p>The Shogun quoted a last verse, and turned
upon me with pedagogical severity. “Woroto
gives no heed to the golden words of the Chinese
sage!”</p>

<p>“Your Highness,” I replied, “if ignorance of
Confucius is the sole test, regard me as a barbarian.
Less than two years have passed since I began
the study of your language with Yoritomo Sama.”</p>

<p>“In the matter of <i>tojin</i> learning, Woroto Sama
is a scholar,” interposed the Prince.</p>

<p>“And a true <i>samurai</i> in battle,” added the
Shogun with a graciousness that, I must confess,
relieved me not a little.</p>

<p>“Your Highness,” I asked, “if inquiry is
admissible&mdash;there were two <i>hatamotos</i> who lived
to see the flight of the <i>ronins</i>. Both fought with
utmost skill and courage.”</p>

<p>“Gengo, as you have seen, has been promoted,”
answered the Shogun. “He did all that his
position called for. Yuki, as captain of the
cortege, was guilty of falling into an ambush.
In consideration of his loyal valor, his life has
been mercifully spared, and his punishment limited
to degradation from the service of the Shogunate.”</p>

<p>Only with utmost difficulty could I maintain
my set smile. Here was bitter requital for service,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>&mdash;the
loyal and courageous <i>hatamoto</i> made a <i>ronin</i>
and beggared because of a surprise which he had
no shadow of reason to anticipate.</p>

<p>“Rumor says that one of the traitors was taken
alive,” remarked the Prince. “Is permission given
to inquire?”</p>

<p>“The criminal refused to speak, and so died
under examination.”</p>

<p>A shudder passed through me at the terse reply.
I called to mind what I had read of rack and boot
and fire and all the other hideous tortures of
mediæval court procedure.</p>

<p>The Prince must have been bitterly disappointed.
He laughed softly, and ventured another inquiry:
“It is rumored that the band came from the
north.”</p>

<p>“They were <i>ronins</i>, formerly in the service
of Mito,” replied the Shogun. “Written declarations
found upon their bodies state that they
had foresworn their loyalty to their lord, and
intended to strike a blow against the Shogunate
in favor of the temporal power of the Mikado.”</p>

<p>“In Tenno’s name, for Mito’s fame,” rhymed
the Prince.</p>

<p>The verse was not improbably a paraphrase
of a classic couplet and must have contained an
allusion beyond the bare meaning of the words.
Iyeyoshi’s face darkened with a double suspicion.</p>

<p>“Eleven years have passed since the Prince of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
Mito was compelled to resign his <i>daimiate</i> to his
eldest son and confine himself in his inferior
Yedo <i>yashiki</i>,” he stated. “Rekko’s enemies
have yet to furnish clear proof that his casting
of bells into cannon was not for the conquest of
the Ainos and the glory of the Shogunate, as was
claimed by him.”</p>

<p>“Mito walks with face to the past and eyes
turned upward,” murmured the Prince. “No
Mito has yet sat on the stool of the Mikado’s
high commander of armies. But neither was
Hideyoshi the Taiko Sama made Shogun. He
held a higher title in the Mikado’s court, and was
supreme general in fact though not in name. Is
it for the glory of our holy Mikado or for the elevation
of Keiki that Mito plots the overthrow of
the Shogunate?”</p>

<p>Stung to fury by the bare mention of the
threatened disaster to his rule, Iyeyoshi bent
forward, his face distorted with murderous rage,
and his hand clutching at the hilt of his dirk.
The Prince, still smiling under the menace of
instant death, kowtowed, and waited on hands
and knees, with his neck bared for the blade.</p>

<p>“Gladly does a loyal subject offer life in confirmation
of sincerity,” he murmured.</p>

<p>The blood curdled in my veins as the full horror
of the moment burst upon me. Unsoftened by
my companion’s submissiveness, the Shogun thrust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
back his long sleeve with his left hand and tightened
his grip on the dirk. His eyes narrowed to cruel
slits. I knew there would be only one movement,&mdash;a
flashing stroke from the scabbard that would
sever the outstretched neck of the Prince. In
the same instant I realized that the death of the
father would mean death to the son and the ruin
of what he valued far above life,&mdash;his mission.
I had pledged myself to help Yoritomo, and&mdash;I
loved his betrothed! What had I to live for?</p>

<p>“Your Highness!” I gasped. “I do not know
all your customs. In China a condemned man
may sometimes receive punishment through a
substitute. Accept my life for the life of my
kinsman!”</p>

<p>The Shogun turned his glittering eyes upon me.
They were as cold and hard and malignant as
the eyes of an enraged snake. Yet the same
impulse that had forced my offer now impelled
me to creep nearer to him, fearful that he might
refuse to accept. I did not realize that my interference
was in itself an outrage upon the dignity
of the Shogun, punishable with death. First
the Prince, then myself! The bared arm of the
despot <span class="locked">twitched&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Suddenly the distorted face relaxed and the
hand on the hilt drew away. Either my offer
had penetrated through the crust of ceremonialism
to the wellsprings of his nature, or, at the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
height of his rage, he had recalled to mind the
power of the friendly Owari party and remembered
that even he had no lawful right to punish a
<i>daimio</i> of the first class other than by deposition
with the sanctioning assent of the Mikado.</p>

<p>“<i>Namu Amida Butsu!</i>” he murmured. “Rage
is an evil counsellor! Be seated. The <i>tojin</i>
offends with his uncouth manners and unsmiling
face. Yet he has proved his high sense of loyalty
and the filial duty owing to his elder kinsman.
I am appeased.”</p>

<p>“Your Highness has spared two unworthy
lives,” replied the Prince. “The loyalty of my
counsel is still doubted. Grant me leave to withdraw,
that I may make proof of sincerity.”</p>

<p>Again a feeling of horror seized me and brought
the cold sweat to my face. The gruesome proof
of sincerity was <i>hara-kiri</i>. I recalled the suicide
of the wounded <i>ronin</i>, and I shuddered. No!
Not even for Yoritomo’s sake could I offer this
sacrifice of myself for his father. I had not been
trained from childhood in the stern <i>samurai</i> code.
Still on hands and knees, I stared up at the clouded
face of the Shogun, in agonized suspense.</p>

<p>At last the clear gaze and unchanging smile
of the Prince won the contest against doubt and
suspicion.</p>

<p>“The sincerity of Owari dono is not questioned,”
replied the Shogun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
But the Prince was still unsatisfied. “There
remains doubt regarding the wisdom of humbly
offered counsel,” he insisted.</p>

<p>“Permission is granted Owari dono to present
the memorial of Yoritomo Sama, which will be
read and considered,” came the welcome response.</p>

<p>We kowtowed together, loudly insucking our
breath to express our gratitude and delight.
The Shogun rose, and we again kowtowed while
he left the room. A screen in the side wall opened
before him and closed again without a sound.
We were once more alone.</p>

<p>As we settled back on our heels the Prince commended
me for my part in the successful outcome
of the audience with a glance of warm approval.
I could not restrain an exultant exclamation:
“We’ve won! He cannot resist Yoritomo’s
facts!”</p>

<p>The Prince touched his lips and signed to the
rear. A shadow passed across my face. I had
not heard even a rustle of silken folds, yet Gengo
the court chamberlain was already beside me.
He kowtowed, and murmured in a tone of
ingratiating obsequiousness: “The august princes
are implored to accept the humble services of
their servant. The condescension of the great
fills with joy the breast of the lowly!”</p>

<p>“The duties of a court chamberlain restrict
his services to his lord,” replied my companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
I had taken a dislike to the man, despite my
remembrance of his braveness and swordsmanship,
but I thought the Prince spoke with undue harshness.
Heedless of the reproof, Gengo looked up,
with a fawning smile, and answered significantly:
“Great men have accepted aid from foxes.”</p>

<p>“A wise man trusts in the gods, and scorns
the goblin power of badgers and foxes,” rejoined
the Prince.</p>

<p>“Gold opens gates that steel cannot force,
my lord.”</p>

<p>“The gates that are already open may crush
those who attempt to close them.”</p>

<p>Gengo cringed and looked up with a bland smile.</p>

<p>“The favor of the exalted Prince of Owari will be
remembered by his servant,” he murmured, and he
kowtowed, laughing softly and sucking his breath.</p>

<p>The Prince signed me to rise. Gengo rose
after us and ushered us out by the way we had
come, with utmost obsequiousness. In the waiting
room our caps and winged jackets were removed
by our chamberlains, who slipped on our
lacquered clogs at the threshold.</p>

<p>Gengo conducted our party out across the inner
moat and through the palace gardens to the gate
in the citadel rampart. There at last he turned
back, while we swung out across the great moat
and homeward along Kojimachi Street, to bear
the good news to Yoritomo.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mito Strikes</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap1"><span class="smcap1">A</span> second period of anxious waiting
followed the visit to the palace.
Yoritomo soon completed his memorial
which his father at once presented
to the Shogun. After that we had
to wait in blind uncertainty of the outcome,
yet aware that the Mito party was gathering all
its strength to bring about the downfall and
destruction of Owari.</p>

<p>On the morning of July the sixth, Yoritomo
came to my apartments for the first long visit
he had been free to pay me since our arrival at
Owari Yashiki. As soon as the attendants had
served pipes and tea and had withdrawn, he
sought to repeat the fervent thanks which he had
already showered on me for my impulsive attempt
to save his father. I could no longer bear his
gratitude.</p>

<p>“Wait, Tomo,” I interrupted. “I have a
confession to make. I am ashamed to receive
your praises. The least I can do is to confess
the bitter truth. I love your little Princess.”</p>

<p>“Do I not already know that?” he replied.
“My brother, I grieve for you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
“Despise me, rather! When I looked into her
Madonna face, I could not resist showing her
my love&mdash;to her, your betrothed!&mdash;and I thought
myself a gentleman!”</p>

<p>“My betrothed only in name, Worth. How
often have I told you that my life has been given?”</p>

<p>“Yet if you succeed?”</p>

<p>He touched his dirk. “You know the customary
proof of sincerity. If that is not required, I
have vowed to shave my head, and enter the
monastery at Zozoji.”</p>

<p>“No, no, Tomo!” I protested. “Consider your
chances for a glorious future. If we win against
Mito, only the life of the feeble son of the Shogun
stands between you and the succession to the
throne. As the husband of the Shogun’s daughter
and heir of Owari, with the strong friendship of
Satsuma&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What is the saying of your great poet?” he
interrupted. “‘Uneasy lies the head that wears
a crown.’ Neither power nor love tempt me.
If now I can subdue my hatred of Mito and his
clan, and fulfil my mission with self-abasement&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Be a Buddhist saint if you must, but when
you have accomplished your mission, your gods
will reward you with a happy life.”</p>

<p>“Your souls have met and loved in some former
reincarnation,” he murmured. “Cast off all
thought of shame, brother. I have no desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
for the maiden. You belong to one another.
Your souls are bound together inseparably.”</p>

<p>“Tomo!” I cried, and I bowed over, between
shame and intoxicating delight.</p>

<p>Fujimaro entered with the freedom allowed
a teacher, and said in his most formal style:
“Permission to enter the august presence is humbly
entreated by a woman of low degree, the <i>geisha</i>
Kohana.”</p>

<p>Yoritomo nodded to me, and I answered:
“Bring her in without delay.”</p>

<p>As Fujimaro glided out, I bent towards Yoritomo
with a quick question: “Another of Keiki’s
plots?”</p>

<p>“Would that be a matter of surprise?” he replied,
with his placid smile. “She will soon tell us.
We were talking of one to whom you have given
your heart with true Occidental romanticism.
I grieve for you, brother!”</p>

<p>“That I should have betrayed my friend?”</p>

<p>“No, not that. I have never stood between
you and the maiden in wish, and will not in fact.
I grieve because I know that your love is hopeless
in this life. At the best, you have only the chance
to unite yourselves in death, and even that union
is no more than a remote possibility.”</p>

<p>“Union!&mdash;death!” I repeated.</p>

<p>“When lovers know there is no hope of union
in this life, they pledge themselves to love one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
another for seven existences, and&mdash;” Again he
touched his dirk hilt.</p>

<p>“That?” I cried. “Ask her to sacrifice herself
for me?”</p>

<p>“You Westerners talk of faith. We practise
it. Azai will gladly end her life here for the bliss
of being joined to you in the world beyond. She
loves you.”</p>

<p>“Impossible! I am a <i>tojin</i>. The very sight
of me frightened her.”</p>

<p>“At the first, yes. Now she loves you. My
father saw your soul in her eyes.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” I repeated.</p>

<p>“Impossible for you to be united in this life,”
he repeated. “None the less, she is yours so
far as love gives you the right,&mdash;and she is yours
so far as the wish of your brother is to be considered.”</p>

<p>“Tomo, you will help me?”</p>

<p>“I will help.” He waved back my outstretched
hand. “They come.”</p>

<p>Fujimaro opened a screen for Kohana San to
enter, and, at a sign from me, withdrew. The
<i>geisha</i> had not paused to cast off her hood and
gray street <i>kimono</i>. Panting from haste and fear,
she glided across to us on her knees, her unsmiling
face pallid beneath its rouge and rice powder.</p>

<p>“My lord,” she gasped, “Mito strikes! The
Council, unknown to His Highness&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
“Midzuano has ordered our arrest,” stated
Yoritomo.</p>

<p>“I have had no calls to Mito <i>yashiki</i>. A delayed
message came from the <i>ronin</i> Yuki, who was
captain of the <i>hatamotos</i>&mdash;Keiki sought to bribe
him against us. He pretended to agree&mdash;”</p>

<p>Yoritomo twisted about to my <i>tokonoma</i> and
opened the lacquered case in which I kept my
revolvers and ammunition. He thrust one of the
revolvers into his bosom, and gave me the other.</p>

<p>“We must stand before the judges without our
swords,” he said. “That is due the dignity of
the court. But we cannot tell how far Keiki
and Midzuano may induce them to proceed.
It is better to die quickly than under torture.”</p>

<p>“And take Midzuano and Keiki with us,” I
added.</p>

<p>“If it comes to the point, and they are present.”
He turned to Kohana San. “You have been
followed?&mdash;seen to enter?”</p>

<p>“Not that I can tell, my lord.”</p>

<p>“Call Fujimaro.”</p>

<p>I clapped my hands, and the chamberlain
appeared at the side of the room.</p>

<p>Yoritomo pointed to the kneeling girl. “Let
denial be made that the <i>geisha</i> who entered
Owari Yashiki was Kohana San. To-night return
the girl to Shinagawa in a <i>norimon</i>, with escort,
incognito, but passing out the main gate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
“My lord! a <i>geisha</i> in a <i>norimon</i>, and carried
through the state gate of Owari Yashiki!” murmured
the outraged chamberlain, masking his
amazement behind his suave smile, yet unable to
repress the note of horror that underlaid his mildly
worded protest.</p>

<p>“Will Keiki then believe the spies that report
the coming of Kohana San to Owari? They
will say she is still here, yet she will be in
Shinagawa.”</p>

<p>“My lord! the life of a dancer against the
dignity of Owari&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The dignity of Owari against the defeat of
those who would ruin Owari and Nippon. The
<i>geisha</i> is now worth a thousand men to Owari.
Seal your lips and the lips of all others. She
will leave the <i>norimon</i> in some dark by-way.
You will loiter through Shinagawa, and return
with one of the guard inside. Go now and request
leave of my august father for us to appear before
him.”</p>

<p>Fujimaro hastened out, and we turned to
question Kohana San. Before she could tell
how the message had reached her, the chamberlain
reappeared, and announced that one of the
Prince’s personal attendants had come to inform
us our presence was desired in the audience hall.</p>

<p>“Mito strikes. It is for us to parry and
counter,” said Yoritomo. We slipped our swords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
into our girdles, and rose. At the threshold
he turned to Kohana San. “Pray to the war god
and to your kitten.”</p>

<p>“Ten thousand felicitous years to my lord!”
she murmured. “The might of Hachiman and
the craft of the <i>geisha</i> cat shall aid him!”</p>

<p>The waiting attendant conducted us direct to
the audience hall, his unsmiling face a portent
of calamity. At the entrance he halted and
kowtowed. We passed in alone. The Prince
was seated in state before the grand <i>tokonoma</i>
and close beside him on his left sat a visitor also
dressed in winged jacket,&mdash;a large and swarthy
man, with features of the heavy German type.</p>

<p>When we entered, refreshments had been served,
and the only retainers present were the six counsellors.
Yoritomo led me to the head of the room,
where we knelt and laid our swords upon the
mats at our right, and exchanged bows with the
Prince and his guest. I had no need of my friend’s
greeting to the stranger to divine his identity.
I had already perceived from the circle cross upon
his coat and his position on the left of the Prince
that he was none other than Yoritomo’s friend
Shimadzu Nariakira, the great Daimio of Satsuma.
Accepting the precedent set by the Prince, he
greeted me as his junior but peer, and proceeded
to look me over with a gaze as frank and kindly
as it was keen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
“Woroto Sama is far different in appearance
from the hairy <i>tojin</i> that I have seen on the black
ships,” he said. “The august Prince of Owari
has told me the deeds of his guest. My regret
is doubled.”</p>

<p>Yoritomo glanced inquiringly at his father, who
explained with utmost calmness of tone and manner:
“Our noble friend, the Daimio of Satsuma,
has received the command of the Shogunate to
bring the heir of Owari and the <i>tojin</i> lord before
the High Court in netted <i>norimons</i>.”</p>

<p>In a flash Yoritomo drew open his robes below
the girdle and placed the point of his dirk to his
side, ready for the fatal cross cut. Calm and
steady as if cast in bronze, he looked up at his
father for the signal to strike. The Prince turned
quietly to his guest. The Daimio sat mute and
impassive. The Prince faced the counsellors,
who consulted together for what seemed to me
an age of hideous suspense. Yet throughout it
all the Prince and the Daimio waited, to all
appearance as apathetic as lumps of clay, while
my friend crouched, no less impassive in look,
the cruel knife held ready to rend his loins in
dreadful self-immolation.</p>

<p>At last the <i>karo</i> spoke, in a voice devoid of
all emotion. “The words of the august lords
have been heard and considered. Humble counsel
is given that Yoritomo Sama should bear the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
present shame and should risk appearance before
the High Court. To commit <i>hara-kiri</i> now would
save his personal honor. It would not be proof
of sincerity should doubt be expressed as to his
motive in presenting the memorial to His Highness
the Shogun.”</p>

<p>The Prince nodded in assent. Yoritomo still
waited.</p>

<p>“Does the Shogun know of this order?” he asked.</p>

<p>“That we have yet to learn,” answered the
Prince. “The risk is great. So also is the chance
of great gain.”</p>

<p>Yoritomo sheathed his dirk, and tendered both
it and his sword to the Daimio. I offered my
sword and dirk. The Daimio smiled gravely,
and waved them back with his fan.</p>

<p>“We shall all lay aside our swords when we
enter the presence of the High Court,” he said.</p>

<p>The Prince clapped his hands, and attendants
entered to take up the swords of the four lords.
The Prince himself escorted his powerful guest
to the state portico, Yoritomo and I following
close after. At the entrance, <i>norimons</i> with
Satsuma bearers and guards were stationed in
waiting for us before the gold-lacquered palanquin
of the Daimio. With no other display of feeling
than the required smile of etiquette, we took leave
of the Prince, slipped our swords into our girdles
and entered our <i>norimons</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
The head of the cortege passed out into the
great courtyard and through the massive gateway,
followed by Yoritomo’s <i>norimon</i> and then by
my own, each surrounded by a guard of stalwart
Satsuma men. The Daimio came after us, near
the end of the procession. Outside the gateway
the heralds began to chant a monotonous cry:
“<i>Shi-ta-ni-iro! shi-ta-ni-iro!</i>&mdash;kneel down! kneel
down.”</p>

<p>As my <i>norimon</i> swung around, I peered out and
saw the standard bearers carrying the insignia of
their lord on tall shafts. The Daimio of Satsuma
was making a state progress. The thought that
we were in the charge of the most powerful of all
the <i>daimios</i>, and that he was our friend, reassured
my apprehensions of the coming ordeal. I drew
a sigh of relief, and was about to settle back in
my narrow box, when something struck lightly
across the <i>norimon</i> and fell down over the windows.
I peered out again, and saw the meshes of a net.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII&mdash;<span class="smcap">In the Pit of Torment</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> ride would have been tedious at
best. With that symbolic net hung over
me, it was well-nigh unendurable.
More than once the indignity of
being paraded as a prisoner through
the aristocratic section of Yedo all but overpowered
my self-control. Only by the severest repression
was I able to constrain myself from drawing
sword and cutting my way out of my enmeshed
palanquin. The saving thought was that Satsuma
had left us our swords and that the net did not
necessarily imply degradation.</p>

<p>With the heralds ever chanting their cry,
“Kneel down! kneel down!” we marched in solemn
state into the official quarter and slantingly
across it, past the great Sakaruda Gate where
we had parted from the cortege of the Princess,
to a gate in the angle of the moat, half a mile
beyond. Here I expected an order for us to
dismount and enter afoot. But the gate led us
into the Second Castle, which is the separately
moated portion of the official quarter, lying along
the east side of the citadel.</p>

<p>We now had to go only a short distance to reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
the <i>yashiki</i> in which the magistrates of the Supreme
or High Court held their sessions. As prisoners
of high rank, we were carried in through the gateway
and across the courtyard to the portico.
The Daimio followed in state. When he had
stepped out upon the mats laid for him by the
<i>hatamoto</i> attendants of the court, the nets were
removed from our <i>norimons</i>, and we were courteously
assisted to alight beside the Daimio. At
a sign from him, we handed over our swords and
dirks to a pair of his own retainers, while he gave
his sword alone into the keeping of one of the
<i>hatamotos</i>.</p>

<p>With this we were ushered after the Daimio
into a waiting-room and served with tea and rice
cakes,&mdash;an extreme of ceremonial hospitality
for which I felt more impatience than gratitude.
We had good reason to believe that those who so
politely entertained us were our enemies,&mdash;that
we were going before a prejudiced court. I wondered
how Yoritomo could preserve his tranquil
bearing. For myself I found much difficulty in
imitating the austere solemnity of Satsuma, whose
deportment I had resolved to copy. In my
perturbed state of mind, the task was by no means
easy, yet I succeeded so far as visibly to impress
the <i>hatamotos</i> with the dignity of the <i>tojin</i> lord.</p>

<p>At last we were summoned into the presence
of the court. The trial chamber was an apartment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
of medium size, divided into a stone-paved
pit, level with the ground below the mansion,
and a matted platform or continuation of the house
floor, three or four feet higher than the pit bottom.
Upon the centre of the platform sat the magistrates
in a row, with several court secretaries or reporters
on their right.</p>

<p>Turning my glance from the judges, I stared
down into the space before them with a thrill
of horror. Along the walls of the pit were ranged
grotesquely modelled instruments and machines,
the very shape of which was a menace and a
torment. Before them stood guards armed with
hooked and forked implements used to entangle
and pin down unruly prisoners. Worst of all
were the three men of the <i>eta</i>, or pariah class,
who knelt beside a post in the centre of the pit,
grim and silent, their cotton robes tucked up into
their girdles, their corded arms bared to the
shoulder.</p>

<p>The three swordbearers knelt in a corner,
while Satsuma was conducted to a cushion on
the left of the magistrates. He seated himself
and exchanged bows with a lean, cold-faced <i>daimio</i>
who had preceded him. A <i>hatamoto</i> signed us
to descend a steep flight of steps into the pit.
Without a shadow of change in his serene face,
Yoritomo led the way down. At the bottom,
attendants slipped lacquered clogs upon our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
feet, that we might not soil our silk foot-mittens
upon the stone flagging.</p>

<p>We halted near the steps, yet close enough to
the post where the pariahs stood for me to see
a splotch of fresh blood on the black-stained
flagstones at its foot. Yoritomo saw me
shudder, and whispered reassuringly, in English,
“Remember, brother, we have the pistols, and
there will be no attempt at torture if we tell the
truth. Conceal nothing except our knowledge
of Keiki’s plot.”</p>

<p>I drew in a deep breath, and turned my gaze
away from the pit, to look at the magistrates.
They were studying me with a supercilious curiosity
such as a lady of fashion might exhibit while
viewing a painted savage. Pride spurred me
out of the black mood of horror and despair
into which I had sunk. With chin uplifted, I
returned the insolence of the judges in a contemptuous
glance. Yet intense as was my anger, I
found myself almost disconcerted when I met the
gaze of the <i>daimio</i> beside Satsuma. His face was
as immobile as a death-mask, and his dull eyes
peered out at me through the narrow lids with a
glassy stare, as cold and emotionless as the eyes
of a corpse.</p>

<p>“Who is that beside your friend?” I muttered.</p>

<p>“The chief of the Elder Council,” whispered
Yoritomo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
I stared closer at the repellent face. This,
then, was Midzuano Echizen-no-kami, the Shogun’s
grand vizier or premier,&mdash;our enemy and the
friend of Mito. What chance had we of a fair
trial before a court influenced if not overawed by
the ally of those who sought our destruction?
According to the ancient law of the land, we had
committed deeds punishable with death. What
possibility could there be for us to escape condemnation
by a court acting in the interests of
our enemies?</p>

<p>“Yoritomo, son of Owari dono!” called one of the
secretaries, and he signed with his fan.</p>

<p>Yoritomo stepped forward before the judges,
and bowed to them with grave dignity. Another
secretary lifted a sheet of writing to his forehead,
and read slowly: “Charges have been made that
Yoritomo, son of Owari dono, left the shores of
Nippon; that he has returned to the shores of
Nippon from the lands of the <i>tojins</i>; and that he
has brought with him into the country a <i>tojin</i>
who belongs to the evil sect.”</p>

<p>The reading of the brief indictment was followed
by a profound hush, in which the only sound I
could hear was the quick drumming of my heart.
The silence was broken by one of the magistrates,
who leaned forward and asked sharply: “What
has Yoritomo Sama to say to the charges?”</p>

<p>The secretaries wetted their inkbrushes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
wrote down the question with swift strokes.
They did not have long to wait for Yoritomo’s
answer. He smiled up into the faces of those
who were about to condemn him, and replied
without a trace of hesitancy:</p>

<p>“Regarding the first and second charges, no
proof can be brought forward by the august
court, yet I speak freely the truth. Many years
have passed since word came from Nagasaki how
the hairy <i>tojins</i> had humbled the pride of the
arrogant Chinese and forced them with cannonballs
to open their ports to <i>tojin</i> trade. That is
well known to all men of <i>samurai</i> blood.”</p>

<p>“It is well known,” assented the magistrate.</p>

<p>Yoritomo bowed, and continued: “When I
had attained to manhood I chanced upon a full
account of the <i>tojin</i> victory and China’s humiliation.
The realization that a like humiliation
might come to the sacred Empire of the Rising
Sun sobered me in the midst of drunken revels.
I put on pilgrim dress and journeyed to the holy
shrine of Ise. There I prayed for enlightenment.
The High Ones sent me a vision, in which I was
directed to cross the seas and learn the secrets
of <i>tojin</i> power. I waited my opportunity, and
embarked in one of the black ships.”</p>

<p>“Your accomplices?” demanded the magistrate
who had spoken before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
“I had no accomplices. I boarded the black
ship unknown to any person in Nippon.”</p>

<p>“Was this at Nagasaki, on the Dutch ship, or on
one of the Chinese junks?” asked another magistrate.</p>

<p>“On neither, nor was it at Nagasaki.”</p>

<p>“Where was it?” queried the first judge.</p>

<p>“That is not to be told,” replied my friend.</p>

<p>The magistrates conferred together in low
murmurs. After a time one of them signed with
his fan to the torturers. As the men advanced,
Yoritomo folded his arms and faced them. Though
I knew his hand was gripped on the revolver under
the edge of his robe, there was no shade of change
perceptible in his serene face. I folded my arms
and reached in to grip my own revolver.</p>

<p>The magistrate nearest Midzuano Echizen-no-kami
leaned towards him as though to catch some
faintly whispered remark. The leading torturer
reached out to grasp Yoritomo’s shoulder. The
magistrate raised his fan in a restraining gesture,
and said authoritatively: “Let the point rest
for the present. The prisoner has confessed to
the first charge. Make note that, according to
his own statement, he left the shores of Nippon.
He was not driven to sea by storm, but boarded
a ship of the <i>tojins</i> and sailed from Nippon of
his own free will.”</p>

<p>“Under the guidance of the gods and for the
sake of the holy Mikado,” added Yoritomo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
One of the judges murmured a protest, but the
last speaker signed to the secretaries. “Write
down the claim of the prisoner,” he ordered.
“Regarding the second charge, it is proved by
the confession of the first. Yoritomo, son of
Owari dono, left the shores of Nippon. He now
stands before us. Therefore he has returned to
Nippon. There remains the third charge.”</p>

<p>“First, as to my return to Nippon,” replied
Yoritomo, “I make defence that, having learned
much of the <i>tojin</i> peoples and their power, I come
back, not in defiance of the edict, but as a loyal
subject, to counsel the Shogunate against the
mistakes of misinformation.”</p>

<p>“Make note that the prisoner confesses his
return to Nippon for the purpose of counselling
the Shogunate with the forbidden knowledge
of the barbarians,” said the magistrate nearest
Midzuano. He turned to Yoritomo and repeated:
“There remains the third charge.”</p>

<p>“The third charge is false,” replied my friend.
“Adamisu Woroto, my august <i>tojin</i> kinsman,
is not a member of the evil sect.”</p>

<p>“Your kinsman?”</p>

<p>“My kinsman,” repeated Yoritomo, and he
gave a terse account of Will Adams, his relations
with the great Iyeyasu, and his descendants.</p>

<p>The magistrates listened with intense interest,
but the recital, instead of softening them, seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
to quicken their suspicions. One of them signed
to the torturers and commanded: “Bring the
<i>fumie</i>.”</p>

<p>Again I gripped my revolver, certain that the
time had come. My first ball should rid the
world of the corpse-eyed Chief Counsellor Midzuano;
after that as many of the perjured judges
as there might be time to remove from office
before the need of putting a ball through my own
brain&mdash;How could Yoritomo stand so serene!</p>

<p>One of the torturers hastened across the pit,
and returned with a bronze plate, which he cast
down on the stone flagging before my friend.</p>

<p>“Tread!” commanded a judge.</p>

<p>Yoritomo smiled, and struck the face of the
plate with one of his clogs. A slight smile
gleamed across the heavy face of Satsuma.
Midzuano betrayed no sign either of relief or
disappointment. The magistrates conferred. The
one who had spoken at the beginning of the trial
nodded to the secretaries. “Make full note that
the prisoner denies the third charge and has trod
upon the image. He may step aside.”</p>

<p>As Yoritomo crossed to the far end of the pit,
the judge signed to me with his fan to come
forward. I advanced and stood facing the magistrates,
with head high and arms folded. Little
did they suspect that their fate was in my hands,
not mine in theirs. Angered by the defiant stare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
of my blue eyes, the youngest judge commanded
harshly: “Kneel down, white devil!”</p>

<p>“White lords do not kneel to the servants of
a servant,” I rejoined, recalling to mind that in
theory if not in practice the Shogun is the servant
of the Mikado.</p>

<p>The man recoiled before my angry gaze, fearful
of my “demon” eyes, while the magistrate next
to him cried out his indignation at my insolence.
But an elder judge quieted his colleagues with a
gesture, and addressed me with calm severity:
“The barbarian speaks with intolerable insolence
to the high retainer of the Shogun.”</p>

<p>“Civility for civility; insolence for insolence,”
I rejoined. “He called me ‘white devil’; you
call me ‘barbarian.’ You are both foolish children,
pitifully ignorant of the mighty civilization of the
<i>tojin</i> peoples. I have come to Nippon with Yoritomo
Sama&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wait,” he interrupted, “First let the charges
against the prisoner be read.”</p>

<p>A secretary raised the indictment to his forehead,
and murmured: “Charges are made that
the <i>tojin</i> companion of Yoritomo, son of Owari
dono, is a member of the evil sect; that he has
discharged a firearm within the proscribed limits
about Yedo; and that he is a spy sent to Nippon
by the barbarians.”</p>

<p>“Regarding the first charge, I deny that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
am a member of what you call the evil sect,”
I stated.</p>

<p>One of the judges pointed to the floor beside
me, with a laconic command: “Tread!”</p>

<p>I looked down at the bronze plate upon which
Yoritomo had trod so readily. On its smooth
surface was incised a Latin cross. I faced my
judges again, prepared for the worst. I was not
a Roman Catholic,&mdash;nor for that matter a
member of any Christian denomination,&mdash;but
I did not propose to spurn that symbol with my
foot.</p>

<p>“Denial of the charge has been made,” I said.
“The word of a <i>tojin daimio</i> is sufficient. I will
not submit to a foolish ceremony.”</p>

<p>“Make note, the prisoner denies the first charge,
yet refuses to tread upon the image,” called the
youngest magistrate, without attempting to hide
his exultance. “Bring forward the witness to
the second charge.&mdash;Stand aside, barbarian!”</p>

<p>As I crossed to Yoritomo, one of the guards
drew away a screen at the edge of the pit, and
exposed to view a clumsy wooden cage. A second
guard opened the cage. From within crept a
half-naked man. The guards caught him on
either side and guided his tottering steps across
to the torturers’ post. Though his face was marked
with the effects of atrocious suffering, I knew him
at a glance. He was Yuki, the captain of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
<i>hatamoto</i> cortege, now beggared and degraded
by a perverse judgment. The freshly healed
gashes on his chest and shoulders confirmed his
identity.</p>

<p>“Has Yuki the <i>ronin</i> thought better of his
obduracy?” demanded the eldest judge. “If so,
let him look upon his fellow-culprits, and speak
the full truth.”</p>

<p>Yuki gazed at us for several moments without
betraying a sign of recognition.</p>

<p>“The truth has been spoken,” he said, facing
the judges. “When the cortege in my charge
was attacked by the <i>ronins</i>, two swordsmen
in monks’ robes slew many of the evil band and
put the survivors to shameful flight. There is
no more to be said by me.”</p>

<p>Instantly two of the torturers seized the heroic
victim and began lashing him to the post. The
sight was more than I could endure. I sprang
forward, and cried out to the merciless judges:
“Hold! Question me first! If your wish is to
prove the second charge against me, I admit
that I used a firearm&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The prisoner confesses to the second charge,”
commented the eldest judge.</p>

<p>“In defence of your Shogun’s daughter,” I
added. “Write that also.”</p>

<p>“Do not write,” commanded the judge.</p>

<p>“I call upon the Daimio of Satsuma to bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
witness,” I cried. “The crime charged was
committed in defence of the Shogun’s daughter
against the attack of evil traitors, yet the Shogun’s
magistrates refuse to make note of the truth.”</p>

<p>“Let the claim of the prisoner be noted,” ordered
the judge.</p>

<p>I turned eagerly to the loyal martyr at the
post. “Speak, Yuki!” I urged. “The truth
is now known. Your testimony will work no
further harm.”</p>

<p>“There is no more to be said by me,” he replied.
“I saw no crime committed by the defenders of
the Shogun’s daughter.”</p>

<p>The deep voice of Satsuma-no-kami brought
all heads towards him: “Permission is requested
of the august magistrates to ask a question.”</p>

<p>“The august <i>daimio</i> is entreated to speak,”
murmured one of the judges.</p>

<p>“Condescend to state the charge against the
<i>ronin</i> Yuki.”</p>

<p>“The obdurate witness has refused to testify
regarding the second charge against the accused
<i>tojin</i>.”</p>

<p>“The charge has now been admitted. The
testimony is no longer required,” remarked
Satsuma.</p>

<p>The judges conferred. If any wished to carry
on the martyrdom of their victim to the bitter
end, their lust for cruelty gave way before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
general eagerness to curry favor with the most
powerful of all <i>daimios</i>. The eldest judge bowed
to him, and responded obsequiously: “Wisdom
flows from the lips of Satsuma-no-kami! The
testimony of Yuki the <i>ronin</i> is no longer required.
He is free to go.”</p>

<p>The <i>daimio</i> drew out his sheathed dirk, and
handing it to an attendant, spoke with deliberate
distinctness: “Present this gift to Yuki, the brave
and loyal <i>ronin</i>, from one who values heroic
conduct. Ask him to await me in company with
my retinue.”</p>

<p>The torturers had already loosened their cords.
When the attendant delivered the dirk and message,
Yuki faced the <i>daimio</i>, and holding the gift above
his head, kowtowed until his forehead touched
the bloodstained stones. He rose and staggered
across the pit to the steps, where attendants
hastened forward to support and conduct out into
the open the man favored by the great <i>daimio</i>.
Even the magistrates followed the departure of
their tortured victim with envious glances.</p>

<p>Only Midzuano the Chief Counsellor had not
been diverted by this touching incident, and at
a whisper from him, the nearest magistrate called
to me sharply: “The <i>tojin</i> prisoner has yet to
answer the third charge.”</p>

<p>I stepped back before the centre of the platform,
and replied: “Instead of coming to Nippon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
a spy, I accompanied Yoritomo Sama my friend
for the purpose of warning his country to prepare
for the appearance of my country’s fleet.”</p>

<p>“Is, then, the <i>tojin</i> disloyal to his country,
that he asserts friendship for Nippon?”</p>

<p>“The warships of my country come upon a
peaceful mission. In loyalty to my country
and no less in friendship to Nippon, I have come
before the fleet with Yoritomo Sama, to counsel
acceptance of the honorable friendship offered to
the ruler of Dai Nippon by the exalted ruler of
America.”</p>

<p>“Intercourse is forbidden. The American envoy
will find the ports of Nippon closed against him.”</p>

<p>“The envoy of my country comes half around
the world, with a stately escort of warships worthy
his rank and his mission. He comes in peace,
with offers of friendship, but he is no low tradesman,
to be turned from your ports without a
hearing. Of this I have come to warn Nippon.
The American admiral will exact a respectful
hearing.”</p>

<p>“Does the <i>tojin</i> threaten? Nagasaki is far
from Yedo. Even should the black ships venture
into Yedo Bay, none but the smallest craft can
come within a great distance of the Shogun’s
city. Can the cannon of the black ships shoot
so far?”</p>

<p>The jeer goaded me beyond discretion. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
rejoined: “There are cities on the shores of Nippon
unguarded by shoals. Can the Shogunate defend
them? If not, what of the prestige of the Shogunate
in the eyes of those who conspire to overthrow
the rule of the Tokugawas?”</p>

<p>Even Midzuano Echizen-no-kami betrayed his
astonishment at so audacious a rejoinder. Perhaps
he was stung by the consciousness of guilt, or
rather, by the fear of exposure. He leaned across
and whispered to the nearest magistrate. The
latter made a signal with his fan, and commanded:
“Enough. There is no need of enforced examination.
The prisoners have made sufficient confession.
They are remanded into the charge of
Shimadzu Satsuma-no-kami, to be brought before
the High Court to-morrow for sentence.”</p>

<p>“For sentence!” I cried, too indignant and angry
to feel thankful for our escape from all attempts
at torture.</p>

<p>Yoritomo clattered across the pit pavement,
and led me to the foot of the steps. Satsuma and
the swordbearers had risen. We shook off our
clogs, and mounted the steps, to follow the Daimio
out of that chamber of judicial torment.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Shadow of Death</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">When</span> we came out into the portico
Satsuma girded on his own sword
and, in the face of the <i>hatamoto</i>
officials, ordered our swords and
dirks to be returned to us. We
were in his charge and not yet under sentence.
Next he called Yuki, the <i>ronin</i>, before him, and
ascertained that the injuries suffered by the brave
man from the torture, though fortunately not of
a permanent character, disabled him from walking
any distance. The Daimio demanded the use
of a <i>kago</i> from the <i>hatamotos</i>, and ordered that
the injured man should be carried before us. With
the <i>kago</i>, the <i>hatamotos</i> fetched the sword and
dirk which had been taken from Yuki upon his
imprisonment.</p>

<p>Yoritomo and I now entered our <i>norimons</i>,
across which the symbolic nets were again flung,
and the procession marched slowly out on its
way to the nearest Satsuma <i>yashiki</i>. I surmised
that the court and the Council of Elders had
thought to flatter the Daimio by entrusting him
with the charge of the heir and the guest of the
Prince of Owari. If so, they had proved their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
ignorance of his warm friendship for Yoritomo,
and must have been both puzzled and chagrined
at his courteous bearing towards the self-confessed
breakers of the law.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I jumped to the rash conclusion
that the great Daimio would interpose
himself between us and our enemies, and, if
necessary, even defy the court. When we entered
one of the lesser Satsuma <i>yashikis</i>, within the
official quarter, our gaoler-host could not have
welcomed us beneath his roof with greater state
and warmer hospitality had we been visiting
<i>daimios</i>. Yoritomo, still in mourning, could not
be present at entertainments. But I was free
to witness the clumsy contests of the Daimio’s
huge and bloated wrestlers, with which he sought
to amuse me while his cooks prepared a feast in
my honor.</p>

<p>After a formal banquet graced by the exquisite
dancing of <i>geishas</i>, I was shown to the apartment
assigned to our use, much exhilarated by the
merriment of the girls and the many thimblefuls
of hot <i>sake</i> that they had served me. Though
the hour was close upon midnight, I found my
friend kneeling beside his silken bedquilts, with
his palms clasped in prayerful meditation.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i> what a long face!” I laughed.
“Get up and dance a hornpipe with me, Tomo-bomo!
Jig till the lamps tumble! In the words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
of Perry’s great brother, ‘We have met the enemy,
and they are ours!’”</p>

<p>“You do not understand, brother,” he replied,
in a tone that brought my dancing feet to a sudden
stand. “It would appear that we have escaped
torture in our examination. You forget the
many tortures inflicted with the death penalty.”</p>

<p>“Death penalty!” I cried, clutching the revolver
through the folds of my robe.</p>

<p>“There is only one certain way of escape open&mdash;a
ball for you; for me <i>hara-kiri</i>,” he murmured.</p>

<p>I stared in bewilderment. “Now? But Satsuma
is your friend. He will stand between&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He cannot save us. Even he dare not venture
to oppose the Shogunate in such a matter.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Our only chance for life is that the Shogun
will take action. The sentence of the court
must be confirmed by the seal of the Council
of Elders.”</p>

<p>“Midzuano has that ready, up his sleeve,” I
interrupted, with forced flippancy. “So we are
to forestall him by the personal application of
ball and blade?”</p>

<p>“Not now, brother,&mdash;not until the last extremity.
The Shogun may interpose even after we
have been led out to the execution ground.”</p>

<p>“But they will search and bind us&mdash;we will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
be unable to avoid the torture and shame!” I
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I must risk all, for the chance of sealing my
memorial with my blood. For you there is the
hope of dying in company with your Princess.”</p>

<p>“Of living and wedding her!” I cried. “Yet
the risk of waiting till the last!&mdash;They will
surely search and bind us!”</p>

<p>“Wait,” he replied, and he sat for some moments
in profound thought. At the end he clapped his
hands, and called to the attendant who appeared:
“The presence of Yuki the <i>ronin</i> is desired.”</p>

<p>I seated myself beside my friend, and waited
with such patience as I could command. Yoritomo
returned to his prayers. Presently a screen slipped
open, and Yuki entered, dressed in new silk garments
and already somewhat restored to strength
by the food and skilful treatment. Though just
roused from the midst of sleep, he came to us
smiling, and kowtowed with courtly politeness.</p>

<p>“Ten thousand felicitous years to Yoritomo
Sama and to the <i>tojin</i> lord!” he murmured.
“Humble thanks are offered to the courageous
swordsmen who saved from shame the daughter
of Minamoto Iyeyoshi my lord!”</p>

<p>“The heart of the brave <i>samurai</i> is loyal even
in disgrace!” commended Yoritomo. “Has Satsuma-no-kami
yet offered to receive the <i>ronin</i>
among his retainers?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
“Offer has not been made, my lord.”</p>

<p>“Your parents survive? You have an heir?”</p>

<p>Yuki bowed to each question. Yoritomo nodded
and continued: “Blessed is the <i>samurai</i> who can
give his life to lift his parents from beggary to
honored affluence; whose heir has full cause to
stand before the mortuary tablet of his father
with grateful reverence! Offer is made to receive
the family of Yuki the <i>ronin</i> into the service of
Owari.”</p>

<p>Yuki kowtowed. “The condescension of my
lord is above the acknowledgment of empty
words. Command the <i>ronin</i> to return into the
hands of the torturers! His gratitude may not
be expressed by the sacrifice of mere life.”</p>

<p>“Service, not martyrdom, is required,” replied
Yoritomo. He drew the revolver from his bosom
and handed it to the <i>ronin</i>. “Bear this in hiding
with the dirk of Satsuma. To-morrow, when we
come from the court, be at hand. If we are led
out to execution, follow. Whatever the strength
of the executioner’s guard, your part is to strike
when I call to you; to cut our bonds, and hold
back the <i>hatamotos</i> while we make use of dirk
and pistol.”</p>

<p>“There will be no mistake. Loyal service is
the joy of a <i>samurai</i>,” responded Yuki.</p>

<p>Yoritomo crossed over to a small writing table,
wrote swiftly, and marked the paper with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
seal. He returned and handed the writing to
the <i>ronin</i>. “At sunrise go with your family to
the Superior Yashiki of Owari, and present this
to my august father.”</p>

<p>Yuki raised the writing to his forehead, kowtowed,
and withdrew.</p>

<p>“What a man!” I exclaimed, in English.
“Still suffering from the hellish work of the
torturers, yet willing to rush to certain death at
a word!”</p>

<p>“Filial piety is the supreme virtue,” replied
Yoritomo. “He will serve his parents, and assure
the survival of his family.”</p>

<p>“But why not reward him for what he has
already done? He has suffered enough. Why
not instead call upon one or more of your own
<i>samurais</i>?”</p>

<p>“Their deed would be attributed to my father,
and he will have enough to withstand as it is.
Upon him alone will rest the burden of barring
the return of Mito to power.”</p>

<p>“Upon him! and he disheartened by the death
of your brother and yourself! You see no hope
for us, Tomo?”</p>

<p>“Not disheartened, but strengthened by the
desire for vengeance. Come, we must rest.”</p>

<p>“Rest?” I exclaimed. “When to-morrow brings
us death, if not torture! I had trusted to the
power and friendship of our host. But now&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
“You have sacrificed yourself for the good of
an alien people, brother.”</p>

<p>“Not altogether alien, Tomo. I have found
myself strangely drawn to your people and customs&mdash;only
this torture&mdash;But I suppose that has its
place in testing men’s souls. Look at this heroic
Yuki! If by any chance we escape, Tomo, I
want that man for my retainer!”</p>

<p>“If we escape&mdash;<i>Namu Amida Butsu!</i>” murmured
my friend, and slipping off his outer robe,
he crept under the silken coverlet of the bed.</p>

<p>“<i>Namu Amida</i>&mdash;” he repeated, and fell asleep
in the midst of the prayer.</p>

<p>Between his tranquillizing example and the
soporific after-effect of the <i>sake</i> I had drunk, I was
soon as sound asleep as Yoritomo, and enjoyed
a profound and refreshing slumber until late the
following morning.</p>

<p>An hour before noon we were roused and waited
upon by polite attendants. Having been bathed,
dressed, and served with food, all with a marked
observance of ceremonial leisure, we were ushered
out to our waiting <i>norimons</i>. In the portico
our host greeted us with utmost gravity, and stated
that every effort of Yoritomo’s father to reach
the Shogun by message or in person had been
blocked by Midzuano.</p>

<p>My friend smiled. “It would seem, Nariakira,
that I am to go a little sooner than I had expected.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
Do not grieve for me. You know that I had
already given my life for the cause before I came
to you in your daimiate. Consider only what
effort can be made to save my noble <i>tojin</i> brother.”</p>

<p>“There is always hope until the sword falls,” said
the Daimio. “You may yet be saved together.”</p>

<p>“I am doomed,” replied Yoritomo. “They
will execute me, if only as the son of my father,&mdash;as
the heir of Owari. But Woroto is a stranger
to the opposing clans. They should be satisfied
to send him to Nagasaki for the Dutch ship to
bear away, as it has borne many of the American
sailors.”</p>

<p>“Not so fast, Tomo!” I put in. “For one
thing, I shipped with you for the cruise. I’m not
going to desert now because we’re on a lee shore.
For another thing, the Mito party is not going
to forgive my share in defeating Keiki’s plot.”</p>

<p>“If any way of escape could be found,” said the
Daimio, “Woroto Sama would be cordially
welcomed at the Castle of Kagoshima. I would
rejoice to receive and honor as a teacher of my
<i>samurais</i> a <i>tojin</i> lord of such prowess and learning.”</p>

<p>“My grateful thanks to the Daimio of Satsuma!
But I have cast in my lot with my friend and
brother Yoritomo Sama.”</p>

<p>“The answer of a true <i>samurai</i>!” commended
the Daimio.</p>

<p>Yoritomo flashed me a swift glance of affectionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
acknowledgment, and turned to enter his <i>norimon</i>.
A few minutes later we were being borne again
through the official quarter as netted prisoners
in the stately cortege of our host.</p>

<p>Near the <i>yashiki</i> of the court I caught sight
of a <i>samurai</i> crouched in the shadow of the wall.
He wore a deep-brimmed hat and was writing
a poem on a long scroll. Though he did not look
up, I knew that Yuki the <i>ronin</i> was at hand to
perform his part.</p>

<p>We entered the <i>yashiki</i> and, having handed over
our swords and dirks, were at once conducted
before the magistrate. To my surprise and relief,
the court was convened in an audience chamber,
not in the horrible trial room. As before, Midzuano
Echizen-no-kami, the Chief of the Council
of Elders, sat at the left of the magistrates.
Satsuma was ushered to a place of equal honor.</p>

<p>My relief was short-lived. I caught the dull
cold stare of Midzuano. Guards with man-catching
hooks and forks closed in behind us.
We were led to the sill of the raised floor upon
which sat the judges and <i>daimios</i>.</p>

<p>“Kneel down! Kowtow!” commanded one of
the secretaries.</p>

<p>“To the servants of the Shogun, the servant of
the Mikado!” called Yoritomo, kneeling and
bowing his forehead to the floor.</p>

<p>I knelt, but sat erect on my heels, a still greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
insult to the Shogunate than my friend’s naming
of the Shogun as the servant of the Mikado.
There was an angry murmuring among the judges.
But Midzuano sat unmoved and whispered quietly
to his servile mouthpiece. He was far more
desirous of our destruction than our disgrace,
and Satsuma had shown sympathy for us. It
was expedient to regard the feelings of the greatest
of clan lords.</p>

<p>The magistrate beside Midzuano stilled the
heated discussion of his colleagues, and addressed
us: “The son of Owari dono has confirmed the
evidence of his treason by his insolent reference
to the great Tycoon. The white barbarian has
proved his uncouth ignorance of etiquette. Let
the sentences against the prisoners be read.”</p>

<p>One of the secretaries lifted a scroll to his forehead,
and read: “Yoritomo, son of Owari dono:
Whereas, contrary to the explicit wording of the
ancient edict, you voluntarily departed from the
shores of Dai Nippon and returned, bearing
the forbidden knowledge of the <i>tojin</i> peoples,
the sentence of the Court is that, for this traitorous
conduct, you shall be borne to Bell Grove in
bonds, there to be bound to a cross and transfixed
with spears, and after death your head shall be
struck off and exposed on a pole.”</p>

<p>In the midst of the hush that followed the reading,
Yoritomo smiled, bowed, and called out in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
a clear voice: “The favor of the high magistrates
will be remembered by Owari’s heir.”</p>

<p>The judges glanced furtively at Midzuano,
plainly troubled by the menace beneath the
suavely ironical words. The Chief Counsellor sat
cold and unmoved. Another secretary raised a
scroll to his forehead, and read:</p>

<p>“The <i>tojin</i> called Adamisu Woroto: Whereas,
contrary to the explicit wording of the ancient
edict, you, a <i>tojin</i>, entered the domain of the Sei-i-tai
Shogun to spy upon Dai Nippon, and whereas
you have confessed to discharging a firearm within
the bounds of Yedo, each of which crimes is worthy
of death, the sentence of the Court is that you
shall be borne to Bell Grove in bonds, there to
be boiled to death in oil&mdash;”</p>

<p>I heard no more of the hideous sentence. The
sound of the reader’s voice dwindled to a drone
like the singing of insects. I swayed forward,
dizzy and pallid. To be boiled alive!&mdash;I forgot
Yuki, but I remembered the revolver in my bosom.
A cold fury of despair seized upon me. I would
end all, now while I had the chance first to send
to hell that corpse-eyed Chief Counsellor.</p>

<p>My hand stole in between the folds of my robe.
Not a moment too soon to stop me, I heard Yoritomo’s
piercing whisper: “Wait! Not now&mdash;not
now!”</p>

<p>The magistrates were rising to leave the hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
of audience. But Midzuano remained seated. I
paused with my hand gripped on the butt of my
revolver. They were minor officials,&mdash;mere tools
in the hands of our enemies. The man who had
dictated their actions still lingered. I could wait.</p>

<p>Midzuano drew from his sleeve a written scroll
and a seal, and called for a brush and ink. One
of the secretaries who had remained brought a
tray of inks and brushes. Midzuano took up a
brush, dipped it in a saucer of freshly ground ink,
and unrolled the scroll.</p>

<p>Satsuma turned his powerful face squarely
about to the Chief Counsellor. “Is Midzuano
Echizen-no-kami in such haste to issue the warrant
of the Council of Elders confirming the sentence
against the prisoners?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Too great zeal cannot be shown in ridding
the land of spies and traitors,” replied Midzuano,
and he filled in a blank space in the warrant with
swift strokes of his brush.</p>

<p>“A word of counsel to the Counsellor,” interposed
Yoritomo.</p>

<p>Two of the guards sprang before him. Midzuano
waved them aside. He did not lack courage
and courtesy. “The condemned men are free
to speak,” he said.</p>

<p>“Midzuano knows that two of the charges
against the <i>tojin</i> prisoner are false,” said Yoritomo.
“Woroto Sama is not a spy, and no more a member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
of the evil sect than are the Dutch at Nagasaki,
who have not been required to tread upon the
cross for a long period. Regarding the third
charge, the act confessed, though against the
letter of the Shogun’s law, was committed to save
the Shogun’s daughter from the shame of captivity.
The warships of the prisoner’s august ruler will
soon appear off the coast of Nippon. Advice is
given that the prisoner be honorably delivered
over to the exalted commander of the American
fleet!”</p>

<p>“Nagasaki is far from Yedo. The hairy barbarians
will hear nothing regarding their countryman,”
replied Midzuano, and he signed the
warrant.</p>

<p>“The counsellor is wise,” I jeered. “He is
well advised to stop the mouths of those who might
tell of his share in the <i>ronin</i> plot against the
Princess.”</p>

<p>Midzuano looked down the room at me with his
dead-alive stare for a full half-minute.</p>

<p>“A false move, brother,” whispered Yoritomo.
“Say no more!”</p>

<p>Midzuano picked up the seal. As he stamped
it in the ink, the floor quivered as if before the
precursor of an earthquake. An instant later
the air resounded with the clangorous boom of a
mighty bell. It was the alarm note of the great
bell at the Temple of Zozoji. Midzuano paused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
with the seal suspended above our death warrant.</p>

<p>There was a scurry in the anteroom, and a
voice cried shrilly: “The barbarians!&mdash;the
barbarians have come! Woe to Nippon! The
black ships enter Yedo Bay!”</p>

<p>Other bells were joining the clamor of their
harsher notes to the sonorous thunder from
Zozoji.</p>

<p>Without a trace of hesitancy or emotion,
Midzuano brought the suspended seal down upon
the warrant. The man was <i>samurai</i> bred. He
straightened and beckoned to the captain of the
<i>hatamoto</i> guard. Perry had come&mdash;and in the
same hour, this cold-blooded Counsellor would
drag us out to shameful execution! I began to
draw my revolver.</p>

<p>“Wait, brother! Not yet!” entreated Yoritomo,
above the thunderous tocsin of the alarm bells.</p>

<p>The captain knelt to receive the warrant. I
glanced about to assure myself that the guard
was not approaching to seize us. Once in their grip,
only Yuki would stand between me and a hideous
death. The risk of his failure was too great. I
could now be certain of myself and of Midzuano
as well.</p>

<p>A <i>hatamoto</i> was approaching us from the rear.
I half drew my revolver. A second glance showed
me that the man was not one of the guard, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
Gengo, the new court chamberlain. He walked
arrogantly up the chamber to the place of highest
honor, before the <i>tokonoma</i>, raised a scroll to
his forehead, and kowtowed with his back to
all in the room. Beams and floors were shaking
and screens rattling in their slots with the boom
of temple bells and the wild clang of firebells
in every quarter of Yedo. The alarm was sweeping
over the city like a tidal wave. Yet not a man
about us stirred. Every eye was fixed upon the
messenger of the Shogun.</p>

<p>Gengo rose, faced about, and displayed the great
vermilion seal of his master upon the scroll. All
in the room, from the humblest <i>samurai</i> among
the attendants to the <i>daimios</i> of Satsuma and
Echizen, kowtowed before the emblem. Gengo
swelled with pride.</p>

<p>“Give heed to the command of His Highness
the Tycoon!” he shouted above the booming
of the bells, and he cried out the contents of the
scroll: “All proceedings against Yoritomo, son
of Owari dono, and Woroto Sama the <i>tojin</i>, are
annulled. The prisoners are freed within the
outermost boundaries of Yedo, upon the recognizance
of Owari dono. Strict obedience is required.
Minamoto Iyeyoshi.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Garden of Azai</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> draught was a bitter one for Midzuano
Echizen-no kami. He thrust
the death warrant into his bosom,
bowed punctiliously to Gengo and
Satsuma, and rose to depart, with
the excuse that he must call a meeting of the
Council of Elders to consider the threatened
invasion of the barbarians. Gengo the chamberlain
withdrew immediately afterwards, too puffed
with importance to acknowledge the nod of
Satsuma.</p>

<p>With the disappearance of the Shogun’s messenger,
the alarm and confusion outside the
audience chamber seized upon the <i>hatamotos</i>
about us. Giving way to the terror which drove
in upon them with the din of the bells and wild
cries from all parts of the <i>yashiki</i>, the guardsmen
flung open the screens and rushed out in a panic
of fear.</p>

<p>The Daimio rose with stately composure, and
signed us to follow him. We went out, escorted
only by our Satsuma swordbearers and the <i>hatamoto</i>
official who, as bearer of the Daimio’s sword,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
had been restrained by his duty from joining the
flight of his fellow-retainers.</p>

<p>The harsh clang of the firebells had now ceased,
and the boom of the temple bells reverberated
at less frequent intervals, but the funereal solemnity
of the tolling served only to intensify to highest
pitch the panic effect of the first wild tocsin. To
the terrified Japanese it was the knell of doom for
Yedo. Excited <i>hatamotos</i> ran about at random
through the rooms and corridors of the <i>yashiki</i>,
their faces distorted with fury and despair, while
from the women’s quarters shrill voices pierced
the frail walls of the palace with shrieks of terror.
With fear run riot in the <i>yashiki</i> of the High
Court, what must be the panic beyond the moats
of the official quarter, among the million denizens
of the lower city!</p>

<p>In the midst of the wild flurry a scowling <i>hatamoto</i>
rushed at me, with furious imprecations.
But as his blade flashed out Yoritomo flung me
headlong away from the stroke, and my Satsuma
swordbearer rushed to my defence. My assailant
barely saved his head by a dexterous parry. Before
he could strike in turn, the Daimio’s swordbearer
called out a sharp command. At the voice of
his superior officer, the assassin leaped back and
sheathed his sword. My defender looked to
his lord.</p>

<p>Satsuma frowned at the <i>hatamoto</i>, and said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
sternly: “So great an insult cannot be endured
even in the <i>yashiki</i> of the High Court.”</p>

<p>“No!” I cried, springing up between the man
and the blade that circled to cut him down. The
Satsuma man checked his stroke in mid-air.
“Sheathe your sword!” I commanded. “The
<i>hatamoto</i> attacked me because of mistaken loyalty.
Let the <i>samurais</i> of Nippon learn that my countrymen
come in peace and friendship, not to kill
or conquer.”</p>

<p>The <i>hatamoto</i> dropped on his knees and kowtowed
to me. But Satsuma shook his head
doubtfully and signed to the swordbearers. “We
will prepare against other efforts of mistaken
loyalty.”</p>

<p>The bearers handed over our swords, and we
passed on out to the portico. The courtyard
was crowded with shouting <i>hatamotos</i>. But the
Satsuma men of our cortege stood as we had left
them, too sternly intent upon their duty to give way
to the general fear and flurry. At a word from
the Daimio, the nets that had been used on the
<i>norimons</i> of Yoritomo and myself were flung aside.
We seated ourselves, and the procession left the
<i>yashiki</i> with all its usual stateliness of parade,
though at a quickened pace.</p>

<p>A few yards beyond the gateway Yuki was
kneeling at the edge of the street-moat to watch
us pass. I saw him lean forward and stare at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
our <i>norimons</i>, then relax and sit back on his heels.
He had perceived from the strain upon our bearers
that our <i>norimons</i> were occupied. Turning a
corner some distance beyond, I looked back
and saw the <i>ronin</i> walking after the rear of the
procession, with a woman close behind him.</p>

<p>The streets of the official quarter swarmed with
<i>hatamotos</i> and the <i>samurais</i> of various <i>daimios</i>,
rushing about, afoot or mounted, some without
aim or purpose, others racing with all possible
speed and directness to fulfil the commands of
their lords. In the midst of the turmoil a captain
of the palace guard galloped up to the procession
with an order for Satsuma to wait upon the Shogun.
The Daimio immediately detached a number of
his retainers to escort us to Owari Yashiki, and
ordered the cortege back to the Sakaruda Gate,
which had just been passed.</p>

<p>The sun was setting as we advanced again along
the great causeway, skirting the well-remembered
scarp of the citadel moat. This time, however,
my attention was directed, not towards the moat
and the mighty rampart on the far side, but to
my left, whence sounded the wild din and turmoil
of a city in panic.</p>

<p>We swung up a slope. From the crest, far
away to the west-southwest, I caught sight of
Fuji-yama’s grand cone rising in purple majesty
through the twilight, while to the southward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
dark sky was streaked with upshooting red and blue
meteors,&mdash;the signal rockets sent up from every
headland along the bay shores. Not Yedo alone
was panic-stricken.</p>

<p>In vain I strained my eyes to discern the
glimmer of ship lights on the vast stretch of the
gulf. But it was easy to imagine the majestic
sight of the great steam frigates <i>Susquehanna</i>
and <i>Mississippi</i> lying at anchor with their consorts,
in the lower bay. I pictured the tiers
of gunports triced open for action, and the grim
guns lurking within, charged and shotted against
treacherous attack. For a moment I felt a pang
of longing, of home-sickness&mdash;but only for a
moment. I had cast in my lot with Yoritomo.</p>

<p>A horseman dashed up the slope after us, and
drew rein beside our party, with a loud command
to halt. The Satsuma men came to a sudden
stand. I peered out and saw that the rider was
Gengo the court chamberlain. He caught sight
of me between the parted curtains, and bowed low
across the barbed mane of his horse.</p>

<p>“The presence of Woroto Sama is required at
the palace,” he called.</p>

<p>At a word from me, my bearers ranged up alongside
the other <i>norimon</i>, until I was within arm’s-length
of my friend’s out-peering face.</p>

<p>“You heard, Tomo,” I said in English. “What
does it mean?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
He fixed a keen gaze upon Gengo, and demanded:
“Does the command include both Woroto Sama
and myself?”</p>

<p>Gengo bowed low as he replied: “The honored
heir of Owari is still in mourning. The presence
of Woroto Sama is alone required.”</p>

<p>“At once?”</p>

<p>“Woroto Sama should mount his led-horse.”</p>

<p>“You bear a written order?”</p>

<p>“The matter is urgent. Time was lacking to
write an order.”</p>

<p>Yoritomo met my expectant look with an anxious
frown. “It is hard to tell, brother,” he answered
me in English. “Had he brought a written
command&mdash;Yet in all this wild alarm, even
the castle must be in a turmoil. They may want
your assurance that the Commodore comes in
peace.”</p>

<p>“Any risk to tell them that!” I cried, and I
called to my escort: “Open! Fetch sandals and
my led-horse!”</p>

<p>In the confusion of my quick scramble out of
the <i>norimon</i> and into the high-peaked saddle,
some one pressed a little square of paper into my
hand. As I set my feet deep in the huge stirrups,
I looked about and saw Yuki slipping out from
among the Satsuma men. Gengo was wheeling
around the other way. My fiery little stallion
plunged free from his grooms, and to gain a better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
grip of the bridle I thrust Yuki’s note into my
bosom. A moment later and I was racing madly
back along the causeway, with Gengo a length in
the lead, yelling for all to clear the road. After
me ran the Satsuma grooms who had charge of
my horse.</p>

<p>Down the slope we tore at breakneck speed,
through the midst of the swarming <i>samurais</i>.
Nimbly as they leaped aside at Gengo’s commands,
we must inevitably have run over more than one,
had the roadway been less broad or the distance
greater. A scant minute brought us to the bridge
of the Sakaruda Gate. A <i>daimio’s</i> procession
was coming down to the bridge from the east.
Regardless of its standards, we cut in ahead and
galloped across the bridge.</p>

<p>At the gateway Gengo leaped off and ran forward
to speak with the gate warden. The latter entered
into a dispute which, though soon settled by Gengo,
gave my grooms time to come panting across
the bridge after us. Gengo hastened back to
me, and cried out with imperative urgency:
“Woroto Sama cannot pass unless on foot, yet
haste is required!”</p>

<p>I thought it no time for insistence upon dignity.
Carried away by the possibility of persuading
the Shogun to receive my countrymen with cordiality,
I sprang off as the Satsuma men grasped my
stallion’s bridle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
“Lead on!” I cried.</p>

<p>He signed to the Satsuma men to return with
the stallion. “To your <i>yashiki</i>. A <i>norimon</i> will
be provided for the <i>tojin</i> lord,” he explained,
and as the grooms hastened away, he led his own
horse forward to place him in the charge of a
palace groom.</p>

<p>The thought flashed upon me that in the heat
and excitement of the panic the sight of my <i>tojin</i>
eyes might cause the blades of other assassins
to leap from their scabbards, or at best cause
serious delays in our advance. I squinted my
eyes, and followed Gengo with my chin on my
breast. Though the gate watch had been doubled,
neither my height nor the whiteness of my forehead
was noticed by the crowd of chattering <i>hatamotos</i>
through which we forced our way under the great
gateway, across the court, and below the inner
gateway on the right.</p>

<p>As we issued into a broad plaza within, Gengo
turned on his heel. For a moment I fancied I saw
chagrin and bitter disappointment in his narrow
eyes. But then his face shone with the blandest
of smiles, and I told myself I had been deceived by
the gathering twilight.</p>

<p>“Woroto Sama is wise to walk humbly,” he
whispered. “Let him continue so, and he will
be conducted safely past all these.”</p>

<p>I followed the gesture that took in the hundreds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
of palace retainers before us, and replied: “Lead
on.”</p>

<p>He turned again and walked swiftly along the
edge of an inner moat of the citadel. I followed
through the midst of the guards and other palace
attendants, still unchallenged and unheeded.
Presently Gengo led me across a bridge to a gateway
whose guards seemed to have deserted their
post. After pausing to peer about in an odd
manner, my guide hurried me through the gateway
with feverish haste. I found myself in one
of the palace gardens. We advanced quickly
along a narrow clean-swept path, between coppices
tenanted only by birds, and our course was so
full of irregular twists and turns that I soon lost
our bearings.</p>

<p>After a few minutes we came to a small pagoda-roofed
kiosk, or summer-house, in the midst
of a grove of gnarled old cherry trees. It was
the first building I had seen in the garden, though
more than once I had heard voices, which led
me to believe that we had passed other houses.
Gengo stopped at the edge of the kiosk veranda,
and kowtowed.</p>

<p>“Woroto Sama will be pleased to wait here,”
he said.</p>

<p>Before I could reply, he hurried on along the
path. Within the toss of a biscuit, he turned a
bend and disappeared. I seated myself on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
edge of the veranda, and waited. About me
was the peaceful hush of the woods with its
twittering birds. The turmoil of the terrified
city barely reached me over the treetops. But
my mood jarred with this sylvan quietude. I
was burning with impatience to reach the Shogun
and protest the absurdity of the wild panic that
had seized upon his people.</p>

<p>I sprang up and paced half way to the next
turn and back again, observing with surprise that
objects were still distinctly visible even in the
shadow of the coppice. We had come so quickly
from where I had parted with Yoritomo that a
full quarter-hour of twilight yet remained. Gengo
could not miss his way for lack of light. Again
I paced towards the turn and back. As I rounded
the kiosk I glanced down the path by which we
had come. At the last bend stood an armored
<i>hatamoto</i> with drawn sword.</p>

<p>My first thought was that the man must be
a foreguard of the Shogun. I waved my hand to
him. In the same instant he whirled up his
sword, and called fiercely: “The <i>tojin</i>! the <i>tojin</i>!&mdash;At
the kiosk! Upon him!”</p>

<p>“Kill the barbarian! kill! kill!” yelled voices
behind him, and as the leader rushed towards
me, other swordsmen charged around the bend
after him, half a score or more in the first bunch.</p>

<p>Between revolver and sword I might possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
have checked and stood off that number, but still
others yelled in the path behind them,&mdash;and
there was utmost need to avoid a clash with the
Shogun’s retainers. I turned and ran up the
path, hoping to overtake Gengo. The <i>hatamotos</i>
redoubled their yells, and dashed after me. I
twisted around the turn, and saw before me, less
than a hundred yards away, a number of lancemen
charging to cut off my retreat.</p>

<p>The silent stealth of this rear attack was more
appalling than the open charge of the other party.
Had these lancemen come a few seconds sooner
I would have been taken by surprise and pierced
by their long shafts without warning. Even as
it was, I had no time for second thought. At
the view-cry of the lancemen, I leaped the hedge
of clipped privet on my right, and plunged straight
into the coppice beyond.</p>

<p>Fortunately my sandals were bound on firmly,
and the coppice, while dense enough to screen
me after a dozen yards, was of willowy shrubs
that did not catch my loose garments or bar my
advance. A louder outburst of yells told me that
the two parties of pursuers had met, and from the
crashing that followed, I knew that they were
beating through the coppice after me in quickly
scattering formation. Had I doubled, they would
have run me down in the first minute.</p>

<p>I kept straight on, trusting to the gathering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
gloom to hide the traces of my flight, and to the
noise of the pursuit to drown the thud of my
iron-shod sandals on the turf. Had the coppice
continued I might have gained enough to slip
around one of their flanks and make my way
back by the path, out of the enclosure.</p>

<p>But within fifty yards I burst out of the thicket
into an open garden that lay about a large lotus
pond. Upon an island in the centre of the pond
stood a kiosk, approached from the left end of the
pond over a narrow high-arched bridge of bamboo.
Beyond, towering high among the treetops,
rose the white roof-crest of a large edifice.
Beneath that crest there was a possibility that
I might find a palace official able and willing
to check my pursuers and conduct me to the
Shogun.</p>

<p>Without a pause, I dashed across the garden,
veering to pass around the left end of the pond.
My pursuers were closer upon me than I had
thought. The leaders, who had been running
silently through the coppice, burst out almost
on my heels. The exultant note of their view-cry
sent me clumping down towards the shore of
the pond at redoubled speed.</p>

<div id="ip_246" class="figcenter" style="width: 398px;"><img src="images/i_263.jpg" width="398" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">“<span class="smcap">Is This Loyal Service?</span>” <span class="smcap">She Asked</span></div></div>

<p>For a while I gained rapidly on the <i>hatamotos</i>,
the mass of whom broke cover soon after their
leaders. Their exultant cries changed to furious
imprecations as they perceived that I was outrunning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
them. But as I plunged down to the
pond bank, a little short of the bridge, I was dismayed
to find that one of the thongs of my right
sandal had burst. A few steps more would find
the sandal loose. I could not stop to refasten
it, nor was there time to slash the thongs of both
sandals and run on in stockinged feet.</p>

<p>The high arch of the bridge caught my despairing
glance. I swung around the shore-post and
clattered up the sharp ascent to the round of the
arch. The bridge was very narrow. They could
approach me no more than two abreast. I would
pick them off at the foot so long as my cartridges
lasted and then do what I might with my sword
to sell my life dearly.</p>

<p>As I gained the top of the bridge I saw a woman
dart from the far end into the kiosk. But the
foremost of my pursuers were already at the
pond bank, and I whirled about, with drawn
revolver, to face them. For all their fierce eagerness,
the sight of the threatening muzzle brought
them to a halt. They had heard of the defeat
of the <i>ronins</i>. The leaders checked those who
followed, and all gathered at the foot of the
bridge, yelling imprecations at the <i>tojin</i>.</p>

<p>“Murderers,” I shouted, “set foot on this
bridge, and you die! Your master the Shogun
sent for me. He waits for me now. Go, fetch
Gengo the chamberlain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
“Liar!&mdash;Fetch bowmen instead!” cried one
of the leaders of the mob.</p>

<p>“Bowmen and musketeers!” cried another.</p>

<p>“Down with the bridge!” yelled a third leader.</p>

<p>The response was instant. A dozen men caught
up the cry and sprang into the pond to hack at
the frail supports of the bridge with their swords.
I sighted my revolver at the foremost. But
before I could fire, several pointed up and cried
to their fellows: “Hold! hold!”</p>

<p>A moment later all were kneeling, even those in
the shallow water of the pond. Something brushed
softly against my sleeve. I turned half about.
Beside me stood the Princess Azai. Her hands
were folded within the long sleeves of her scarlet
<i>kimono</i>, and she was gazing down upon the mob as
tranquilly as if contemplating the irises in the pool.</p>

<p>When she spoke her voice was barely audible
above the labored breathing of the <i>hatamotos</i>.
“Is this loyal service?” she asked. “Let explanation
be made why you seek to murder the honored
friend of your lord.”</p>

<p>“The august lady errs,” ventured one of the
leaders. “We seek to rid the august lady’s
garden from a defiling beast,&mdash;that <i>tojin</i> devil!”</p>

<p>“Is it error to speak highly of the august lord
who saved your master’s daughter from the
shame of <i>ronin</i> capture? The presence of Woroto
Sama honors the garden.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
“The black ships of the barbarians glide up
the bay against wind and tide, propelled by evil
magic!” cried another <i>hatamoto</i>. “In the morning
they will destroy all Yedo with their cannon.
This <i>tojin</i> is their spy, august lady. Give him
to us!”</p>

<p>“That is a double lie,” I rejoined, “a lie
born of cowardice. Every man among you knows
that the black ships cannot approach near enough
to Yedo to throw a cannon ball into the city.”</p>

<p>“Spy!” hissed the mob. “The court found
you guilty!”</p>

<p>“And the Shogun annulled the sentence! Find
Gengo, and learn the truth.”</p>

<p>“There is no need, my lord,” said Azai, and she
bowed low to the kneeling <i>hatamotos</i>. “Permission
is given to withdraw.”</p>

<p>The men upon the bank kowtowed. Those in
the water waded ashore. All set off across the
garden, without so much as a murmur.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX&mdash;<span class="smcap">Love Laughs at Locksmiths</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Princess turned slowly about to
face me, with no change in the
quiet composure of her bearing. But
as her soft eyes met mine their long
lashes drooped and the delicate rose
tint of her cheeks deepened to scarlet. She sank
to her knees and bowed with exquisite grace.</p>

<p>“The august lord is implored to pardon the
rudeness of the <i>hatamotos</i>!” she murmured.</p>

<p>“The <i>tojin</i> implores pardon for intruding upon
the privacy of the august lady!” I replied.</p>

<p>She bent forward. “The thong of my lord’s
sandal is loose. Permit me to fasten it.”</p>

<p>I stepped back hastily and knelt on one knee
to tie the thong myself.</p>

<p>“The request cannot be granted,” I said.
“In my land it is etiquette for lords to fasten the
sandals of ladies; not the reverse.”</p>

<p>“How contrary to all reason and propriety!”
she exclaimed, and she gazed up at me with a look
of timid wonderment.</p>

<p>I rose and offered her my hand, momentarily
forgetful of etiquette. She sprang up, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
repellent gesture and a sharp little cry: “No!
Setsu!”</p>

<p>“He sought to touch my august lady!” hissed
a voice behind me.</p>

<p>I wheeled and confronted the younger of Azai’s
<i>samurai</i> women, standing very near me, with
her hand on the hilt of her dirk. I looked steadily
into her angry eyes, and smiled at her through the
gloom.</p>

<p>“O Setsu San will believe that no rudeness
was intended by the ignorant <i>tojin</i>” I said. “In
his land courtesy requires a lord to offer his hand
and assist a lady to rise.”</p>

<p>O Setsu San bowed to hide her amazement,
and murmured to her mistress: “Grant permission
for me to conduct the <i>tojin</i> lord from the enclosure.
The presence of a stranger is not permissible.”</p>

<p>“Gengo the chamberlain brought me into this
garden and left me at the summer-house yonder,”
I explained, pointing towards the coppice. “My
understanding was that he went to fetch the
Shogun or some high official. Hardly had he
gone when the <i>hatamotos</i> appeared and charged
upon me without provocation.”</p>

<p>“They are the guard from the nearest gate,”
said Azai. “Such rudeness may not be disregarded.
Command will be sent them to commit
<i>hara-kiri</i>.”</p>

<p>“No!” I protested. “They erred through overzealous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
loyalty, misled, I suspect, by the same
plotters who set the <i>ronins</i> upon your cortege.”</p>

<p>“Keiki!” murmured O Setsu San, with subtle
intuition.</p>

<p>“Keiki&mdash;and others. But I intrude upon the
privacy of the Princess. Tell me which way I
should go to leave the enclosure.”</p>

<p>“Had Gengo orders to bring you into the
presence of my august father?” inquired Azai.</p>

<p>“He stated that my presence was required at
the palace. Was I wrong in believing that the
Shogun had sent for me?”</p>

<p>Azai looked earnestly at her lady-in-waiting.</p>

<p>“Should Woroto Sama attempt to pass out
alone, he would be slain!”</p>

<p>“Grant permission for me to lead him across
into the palace,” said O Setsu San.</p>

<p>“Would your presence serve to shield the august
lord from the <i>hatamotos</i>?” replied the Princess.
“I myself will conduct him.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” gasped Setsu, in open dismay.
“Even for the daughter of the Shogun to have
come between the angry <i>hatamotos</i> and the <i>tojin
sama</i> is unbelievable!”</p>

<p>“O Setsu San will be so kind as to bring my
clogs,” murmured the Princess with gentle
courtesy.</p>

<p>For the first time I noticed that the little silk-clad
foot peeping from under the edge of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
<i>kimono</i> was without clog or sandal. When Setsu
ran in to tell of the chase of the <i>tojin</i>, her mistress
had darted out and up the bridge to my rescue
without stopping for footwear.</p>

<p>“Princess,” I said, “O Setsu San is right.
I cannot accept the offer.”</p>

<p>“My lord will not refuse me the favor,” she
murmured, with a smile irresistibly sweet and
naive. “The kind O Setsu San hastens to fetch
my clogs.”</p>

<p>Perceiving the inflexible will beneath the soft
accents of her mistress, the <i>samurai</i> lady turned
to patter down the bridge. I was alone with the
Princess,&mdash;probably the first man to be alone
with an unwedded daughter of the Shogun for
more than two centuries! I dropped on one knee
to look into her modestly lowered eyes. Through
the gathering darkness I saw a deep blush mantle
her pale cheeks as with girlish bashfulness she
raised one of her sleeves to hide her face.</p>

<p>“Azai!” I murmured. “Is the <i>tojin</i> so frightful
an object to you?”</p>

<p>She dropped her sleeve and gazed at me wide-eyed,
in instant forgetfulness of self. “Pardon
the rudeness!” she exclaimed. “The august lord
should not humble himself by kneeling to a girl!”</p>

<p>“Azai, forgive me for the great rudeness, but
in my country men love and honor pure maidens as
they love and honor their mothers, and it is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
custom to speak of that love even before marriage.
Little Princess, I have been told that your august
father and the Prince of Owari arranged for you to
wed my friend Yoritomo Sama. But my friend
has vowed to become a monk at Zozoji, and he
has told me that my soul shone in your eyes.
Azai, I love you with a love higher and deeper
than any man of Nippon bears towards his wife
and mother!”</p>

<p>She knelt and bowed low to me. “My lord,”
she whispered, “it is unbelievable that so great
a love could be given a mere girl!”</p>

<p>“Your soul is in my eyes, Azai! Say that
you love me!”</p>

<p>“My lord, I should rejoice to be accepted as
the humblest serving-maid in all your <i>yashikis</i>!”</p>

<p>“You love me!” I cried, and drawing her up
by one of her tiny plump hands, I bent close.
“In my land, august lady, it is required to seal
the confession of love in this manner.”</p>

<p>At the touch of my lips to her rosebud mouth
she drew back with a startled sob. But I
resisted her gentle efforts to withdraw her hand.</p>

<p>“Do you not trust me, Azai?” I asked, bending
to watch her downcast face in the dim light.</p>

<p>“Shame has overcome me!” she sobbed. “Nowhere
is it written that man and woman should
hold one another’s hands or touch lips together.”</p>

<p>“If that is hateful to the Princess&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
“Not hateful! but blissful&mdash;blissful beyond
words. That is the shame. I do what is very,
very wrong, yet am glad. I am a most wicked
and depraved girl! Shame overcomes me!”</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Azai! Through my selfish fault
I have brought grief upon the maiden whom I
love more than life. I will go now, and never
trouble you again.”</p>

<p>I freed her hand and rose, but in the same instant
she was erect before me, her little hands clutching
the bosom of my robes.</p>

<p>“Thou! thou!” she whispered. “Do not go
in anger, else I shall die!”</p>

<p>I crushed her to me and rained kisses upon her
upturned face, in a passion of adoration. For a
few brief moments of ecstasy I held her, and she
made no attempt to free herself, but lay upon my
breast like a captive dove, quivering and bewildered.
Then, all too soon for my blissful intoxication, her
cheeks paled from scarlet to ivory white and her
fluttering little heart beat against mine with
sudden steadiness.</p>

<p>“My lord,” she said, “there is no time to be
lost. Setsu comes with a lantern. We must
act at once. Here below the centre of the bridge
the pond is deeper. We will leap in together
and grasp the lotus roots at the bottom.”</p>

<p>“Leap off?&mdash;grasp the lotus roots?” I repeated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
“My lord lover is of noble blood! A thousand
pardons! But Setsu comes quickly. Make haste
to strike me through the neck with your dirk.
You will still have time to commit <i>hara-kiri</i>.”</p>

<p>The word was a flash of clear light through the
fog of my bewilderment.</p>

<p>“No!” I cried. “We will live, to be united
in this life!”</p>

<p>“That cannot be, my lord!”</p>

<p>“I will win and wed you, in the teeth of all
Nippon!”</p>

<p>“My lord, I&mdash;” Her whisper thrilled with
quick alarm. “Free me&mdash;Setsu&mdash;she’ll kill
you!&mdash;disgrace&mdash;a girl’s dirk!”</p>

<p>I released her, and turned to the upward hastening
Setsu as the light of her paper lantern glowed
upon us through the darkness.</p>

<p>“Pardon, august ones!” she called. “The charcoal
had burnt out and the tinder was misplaced.
I could come no sooner.”</p>

<p>“You have done well to come so soon,”
murmured Azai.</p>

<p>O Setsu raised her lantern and peered at me
under it as she bowed. Her utter devotion to the
Princess could not be doubted. I felt a sudden
impulse to risk all in her keeping.</p>

<p>“Does O Setsu San desire the death of her
Princess?” I asked.</p>

<p>The girl grasped at her dirk, and cast a swift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
glance from me to Azai. “Does the <i>tojin sama</i>
threaten?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Only you do that,” I replied. “Strike me,
and your dirk will pierce through my heart to
hers.”</p>

<p>The girl stepped nearer to her mistress and
stared at her dismayed.</p>

<p>“The truth is now known to you,” whispered
Azai. “We love.”</p>

<p>Again Setsu grasped her dirk. “Only an evil
<i>tojin</i> would dare speak of such a matter to the
Shogun’s daughter!”</p>

<p>Death was nearer to me than when the <i>hatamoto</i>
struck at me in the <i>yashiki</i> of the High Court.</p>

<p>“Through my heart, to her heart!” I repeated.</p>

<p>The girl glanced doubtfully to Azai. I forced
a smile. “The Princess has proposed that she
and I should unite ourselves by passing through
the gate of death. I have answered that I will
wed her in this life.”</p>

<p>“The <i>tojin</i> is unwilling to give proof as to the
trueness of his love,” she jeered.</p>

<p>To this there was only one answer that could
convince her. I knelt and placed the point of
my dirk to my heart.</p>

<p>“The <i>tojin</i> belief is that sincerity comes from
the heart,” I said. “Say the word, and I will
prove my love without asking the maiden to
sacrifice herself to join me. I trust her soul to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
find mine when the time comes for her to leave
this life.”</p>

<p>There was no pretence in my words. I had
lived too close to Yoritomo to escape the influence
of his Buddhistic philosophy and his <i>samurai</i>
contempt for death. My love for my little
Madonna Princess was greater than my love of
life, and I knew that only a love equal to my own
could have enabled her to overcome the extreme
modesty and reserve of her breeding. I believed
that death would unite us in the next life, if not
in many future lives; while, if Setsu opposed me,
I could not hope to win my darling in this life.</p>

<p>“Say the word, girl!” I repeated.</p>

<p>“Wait! wait, my lord!” cried Azai, and she
knelt beside me. “First free me, that I may go
with you.”</p>

<p>“You will follow when your time comes,” I
said. “A <i>tojin</i> may kill the woman he loves only
to save her from a fate worse than death.”</p>

<p>“Life without you, my lord!&mdash;what harsher
fate?”</p>

<p>A steel blade flashed in her upraising hand.
I caught her wrist, as she drew back and stabbed
the point at her throat.</p>

<p>“Take her away, Setsu!” I begged. “She must
live and be happy. She is very young.”</p>

<p>“The men of Nippon do not love as my lord
loves!” murmured the <i>samurai</i> girl. “We will go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
before with the light. Let him follow at a little
distance. The darkness deepens. He will not be
seen until we come to the gate.”</p>

<p>Azai rose and slipped on the tiny high clogs
of gold lacquer that were held for her by the kneeling
girl. She bowed to me from the miniature
height with entrancing grace.</p>

<p>“I beg my lord to rise and sheathe his dirk
until it is needed. We now go to my father.”</p>

<p>She turned and pattered quickly down the
bridge to the pond bank, while Setsu, following half
a step behind, held the lantern in such a manner
as to shed no light to the rear. I slipped my dirk
into its sheath and descended after them, my
thoughts in a whirl of conflicting emotions.</p>

<p>From the edge of the pond the little Princess
led the way through a shrubbery, along a winding
path, towards the edifice I had seen in my flight
before the <i>hatamotos</i>. We soon came in sight of
the lanterns strung along the deep verandas of
the building. But Azai turned off to the right,
and tripped away down a side path that skirted
around her palace.</p>

<p>A short walk brought us into a broad avenue
that ran up to a high bridge across one of the inner
moats of the citadel. Setsu hastened on towards
the gateway of the bridge. Azai paused for me
to overtake her. In the garden path there had
been no one to meet or pass; now, however, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
rose the question of facing the guard at the gate.
When I came up close beside the Princess I perceived
the outline of her little hands before her
bosom, clasped palm to palm in prayer.</p>

<p>“We stop here, my lord,” she whispered.
“Setsu goes ahead to see who is on guard.”</p>

<p>“Azai,” I replied, “for you to appear with me
is too great a sacrifice of your dignity. Press your
lips to mine, and say farewell. I will go on
alone.”</p>

<p>She caught at my sleeve. “Wait, my lord!
I will go with you. There is only this little time
left us. When my father learns, I fear he will
forbid me even to dream of you. They have
told me that I shall be required to wed Keiki
if Midzuano’s counsel prevails.”</p>

<p>“You would not wed the man who set the
<i>ronins</i> upon you!”</p>

<p>“A good daughter should obey with docility
when her father chooses her husband. Yet I
have never before heard of a lady meeting a
lord and loving before marriage, as I love my
lord!”</p>

<p>“Little maiden!” I exclaimed, “you again
confess that you love me! How can you speak
of wedding another?”</p>

<p>“My lord wonders? Yet he knows that the
supreme duty of a woman is willing obedience,&mdash;first
to her father, then to her husband, and last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
of all to her eldest son. I know that my august
father holds me in higher regard than is deserved
by so worthless and contemptible a creature as
a young girl, and because of his gracious condescension
I owe him the utmost of gratitude and
obedience.”</p>

<p>“You will wed Keiki if your father commands?”
I asked.</p>

<p>Her voice quavered. “I pray to Kwannon
to aid me! If so great a trial comes upon me, I
fear I must fail in the one great virtue; I must
oppose the will of my father!”</p>

<p>“You will refuse Keiki, and wait for me,
Azai?”</p>

<p>“I will wait for you in the life beyond&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not that!” I exclaimed in dismay, “not
that, Azai! Wait for me here, in this life!”</p>

<p>“I will try, my lord. Look! Setsu waves her
lantern. We can pass in safety. But first&mdash;if
my lord desires to press his lips upon mine,
I&mdash;I will not seek to escape.”</p>

<p>Half a minute later she sought to release my
embrace with her gentle fingers.</p>

<p>“My lord,” she whispered tremulously, “I
never knew that it was so delightful to love! It is
very wicked to speak so foolishly, yet I wish that
I might stand forever with my lord as we stand
now. But Setsu turns back. We must go.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jarring Counsellors</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">Setsu</span> met us midway, but turned again
the moment the glow of her lantern
fell upon her advancing mistress. Azai
joined her, while I fell back into the
darkness. When the maidens came
within the narrow circle of light shed by the
gateway lanterns, Setsu signed me to stop. They
went on a few steps, and entered the gate lodge.
After a short wait, Setsu reappeared and beckoned
to me.</p>

<p>As I advanced she stepped back through an
opening in the wooden night shutters of the
veranda. I hastened forward, but paused at
the edge of the veranda, hesitating whether I
should loosen my sandals. Across from me the
shadows of a man and a woman were silhouetted
on the white paper of the wall screens by the
lamplight. The shadow of the woman bowed
and glided off to the right.</p>

<p>The man’s shadow moved a little to the left,
and the screen on which it was cast slid aside.
Before me stood a white-bearded <i>hatamoto</i> in
helmet and cuirass. Half unconscious of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
act, I put my hand on my swordhilt. The <i>hatamoto</i>
kowtowed.</p>

<p>“Command has been given that my lord is
to be conducted into the presence of the Shogun,”
he murmured.</p>

<p>I signed him to rise. He slipped back into
the lodge, and came out again to kneel and offer
me a deep-brimmed hat of plaited rattan. I set
it on my head, while he stepped into a pair of
clogs and turned to lead me out through the
gateway. I looked for a last vision of my little
Princess, but she failed to reappear, and I had
sufficient discretion to refrain from asking
questions.</p>

<p>We advanced under the gate roof, our presence
loudly announced by the scuffle of my sandals and
the clang of my escort’s iron-shod clogs on the
stone flagging. A number of helmeted guards
started out at us from either side. But they
fell back on the instant, and their ready salutes
told me that my companion was the captain of
the gate. Without a pause, we passed on through
and out across the high bridge that spanned the
moat. From the centre of the arch I could look
over at the lantern-hung verandas of the palace.</p>

<p>At the far side of the bridge we came to a second
gateway, the heavy doors of which were closed
and barred. My escort spoke to one of the guards
who peered out at us from the projecting porter’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
window, and after a short delay a small side
wicket was unbarred for us. We crept through,
and passed between two groups of silent guards,
and up a short avenue of cryptomerias to the
nearest wing of the palace.</p>

<p>After leaving the gate we met no one until we
had reached the palace veranda and removed our
footwear to enter. As we crossed the polished
planks one of the screens of the unlighted room
within slid open before an out-hurrying official.
At sight of me the man halted abruptly where
the glow of the porch lanterns shone full upon his
face. It was Gengo the chamberlain. Never
had I seen a man more startled. He stood with
jaw dropped and eyes distended, glaring as if I
were a ghost or demon.</p>

<p>Politely ignoring the strange conduct of his
superior officer, the gate captain saluted and
smilingly stated his errand: “Command has been
given that my lord is to be conducted into the
presence of the Shogun.”</p>

<p>Gengo sank down and kowtowed at my feet.
“Pardon is implored for the inexcusable carelessness
of my lord’s humble servant!” he mumbled.
“It was necessary to leave my lord alone in the
garden. I returned with utmost haste, but my
lord had vanished, and I could not find him.
I was returning even now to make search. The
Shogun has summoned my lord.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
He rose and bowed me to follow him. I signed
to the old gate captain, who appeared to consider
the final words of the chamberlain as a dismissal.</p>

<p>“Come with me to the threshold of the audience
chamber,” I said.</p>

<p>Gengo nodded to the guardsman and smiled
blandly. “The commands of my lord are the
pleasure of his servants,” he murmured.</p>

<p>The readiness of his assent lessened my suspicion
of the fellow. But as we entered the dark
interior I took the precaution of keeping near the
captain. I could not tell for certain whether
the chamberlain had knowingly led me into an
ambush in the garden. Yet if innocent, why had
he been so startled at my appearance? At first
thought his terror seemed an unmistakable confession
of guilt. Then I remembered his fear
in the presence of the Shogun, and coupled it
with his present haste and his no less feverish
eagerness in fetching me to the citadel. Was it
not probable that he had blundered his orders
in the confusion of the panic, and now feared that
I would make complaint?</p>

<p>One thing alone was certain: This time he was
intent on avoiding all mistakes, voluntary or
involuntary. Straight as the lay of the rooms
and corridors would permit, he led the way through
the wing of the palace, and around the end of
an inner garden court. A few steps more and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
we came into a dimly lighted anteroom, where
guards and chamberlains crouched in waiting,
flushed and bright-eyed with excitement, but
silent as death. Beyond sounded a murmuring
of low voices.</p>

<p>Gengo pointed to my sword and dirk. I drew
them from my girdle with their scabbards and
handed them to the old gate captain. The
chamberlain whispered to a fellow-official who was
kneeling close beside the wall at the upper end of
the room. The latter at once drew open one of the
screens, and Gengo entered on hands and knees.</p>

<p>I stepped forward to follow him. The doorkeeper
whispered a startled command for me to
kneel. But rather than crawl into the presence
of their ruler in the posture of a dog, I preferred
that the Japanese should consider me ignorant
or even insolent. To the horror of the doorkeeper,
I strode into the audience chamber proudly
erect.</p>

<p>The large room before me was flooded with
the soft rays of many lamps and lanterns. In
the centre of the apartment the Shogun sat upon
a low dais, close before which, to right and left,
were grouped the few persons in attendance.
I saw the long aristocratic face of the Prince of
Owari and Satsuma’s heavy German visage on
the left of the throne. Across from them knelt
Midzuano the Chief Counsellor and three others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
whose faces were turned from me. I gathered
that the Shogun had called together an informal
council of the leaders of both factions, in the hope
of uniting them in the face of the supposed peril
to all.</p>

<p>Unable to wait for the slow crawl of Gengo,
I stepped past him up the room, and, heedless
of Midzuano’s imperative gesture to fall upon
hands and knees, crossed swiftly over the intervening
mats to the dais. As I knelt to kowtow,
the man beside Midzuano turned, and I saw the
beautiful vindictive face of young Keiki.</p>

<p>I rose and slipped aside towards Satsuma.
Keiki and Midzuano were glancing up at the
Shogun with eager expectancy beneath their
court smiles. The outrageous conduct of the
barbarian had laid him open to severe punishment.
The two other men, who were unknown to me,
regarded me in a neutral manner. I deepened
my smile, and looked up into the gloomy face of
Iyeyoshi.</p>

<p>“The <i>tojin</i> lord comes quickly in response to
our summons,” he said in a colorless tone, and
he signed to Gengo to withdraw.</p>

<p>“Your Highness would have found me in
attendance much sooner, had I not been led astray
in the palace gardens,” I replied, keeping a side
glance on Midzuano and Keiki. The latter flushed
with a momentary outflashing of chagrin; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
Chief Counsellor stared at me with his dull unblinking
gaze, and gave no sign.</p>

<p>“Led astray in the gardens?” questioned the
Shogun.</p>

<p>“At sunset, Your Highness, on my way to
Owari Yashiki from the High Court, Gengo overtook
me, with word that my presence was required
at the palace.”</p>

<p>“At sunset?&mdash;Command was not sent until
after the arrival of Owari dono.”</p>

<p>“Your Highness,” murmured Midzuano, “foreseeing
the need for the presence of the <i>tojin</i>,
command was sent by your humble counsellor.
The <i>tojin</i> owes the credit of his quick appearance
before Your Highness to the forethought of one
whom he unjustly considers an enemy. I venture
to speak because my sole desire is the safety and
honor of the Shogunate. All friends of Nippon
must forget past differences and unite in the face
of the invading barbarians.”</p>

<p>The man’s adroitness astonished me. In a
few words he had claimed credit for foresight,
moderation, and patriotism, had accused me of
cherishing undeserved enmity against him, and
had diverted the attention of all to the burning
question of the American expedition in such manner
as to rouse suspicion against me and increase
their fear and hatred of the supposed invaders.
He need have had no apprehension that I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
complain of the treacherous attack in the garden.
Keiki’s vindictive look had quickened my suspicions
to moral certainty; but this was not the time to
speak of a matter that involved Azai.</p>

<p>“Your Highness,” I said, deepening my smile,
“the wise Chief Counsellor has spoken well according
to his limited information. He should not
be blamed if, at such a time of panic and confusion,
he permits inquietude to so disturb his
sound judgment that he states what is not true.
It is a false rumor that says the Americans have
come to invade Nippon.”</p>

<p>“False?” cried Keiki, “false?&mdash;when the
black ships have entered Yedo Bay in defiance
of the edict!”</p>

<p>“They come in peace. The Dutch told the
Shogunate to expect the expedition.”</p>

<p>“The Dutch did not say that the American ships
would come to Yedo Bay,” said the older of the two
strange <i>daimios</i> who sat between me and Keiki.</p>

<p>“How should the Dutch know?” interposed
Satsuma in a voice resonant with depth and
power. “The Dutch are a little people. Can
they foresee the actions of a great people? The
Americans have shown boldness and wisdom in
coming direct to Yedo Bay. Nagasaki is a long
way from Nippon.”</p>

<p>“Does the Daimio of Satsuma favor the mission
of the barbarians?” demanded Keiki.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
“I favor calmness and reasonable consideration
of the purposes of the <i>tojin</i> visitors. I do not
shriek for the destruction of envoys who, according
to my friend Woroto Sama, come in peace and
friendship.”</p>

<p>“Is it friendly for them to force their way into
the Bay of Yedo?” insisted Keiki.</p>

<p>“Nagasaki is a gate half open, but far away
from the ear of His Highness,” said Owari. “The
<i>tojin</i> peoples know that the ancient laws forbid
all communication whatever. If the Shogunate
sets aside the edict of non-intercourse, it may as
well set aside the edict forbidding the entrance
of <i>tojin</i> ships into other ports than Nagasaki.”</p>

<p>“The ancient laws are immutable. They may
not be set aside,” murmured Midzuano.</p>

<p>“Have I heard that the Council of Elders
has punished those who study the Dutch learning
or those who teach the history of Nippon?”
demanded Satsuma. “Both are crimes forbidden
under penalty of death. Yet a Prince of Mito
caused the history to be printed.”</p>

<p>“Let the <i>tojin</i> lord speak,” interposed Iyeyoshi.
“I have commanded your attendance before me
to advise on the coming of the black ships.&mdash;Answer
truthfully, <i>tojin</i>! Rumor says that the
fleet of your people is greater than the fleet of
Kublai Khan.”</p>

<p>“Your Highness,” I answered, “messengers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
will soon bring you the exact count of the ships in
the fleet of the American envoy. Others may
have joined those which I saw assembled in
China, yet I can state with certainty that, all
told, they will number less than ten. I place
the count at five or six.”</p>

<p>“Less than ten!” repeated Keiki. “Give command,
Your Highness! The clans of Mito and
Hitotsubashi will unaided board the black ships
and destroy the hairy barbarians with our swords!”</p>

<p>The vaunt was too absurd for me to contain
my amusement. I chuckled openly.</p>

<p>“The <i>tojin sama</i> mocks,” protested the <i>daimio</i>
beside me. “Has he not heard how the swordsmen
of Nippon destroyed the vast fleet of Kublai
Khan?”</p>

<p>“Abe Ise-no-kami speaks to the point,” commented
Midzuano. “Can Woroto Sama refute
him?”</p>

<p>“Without aspersing in the slightest degree the
prowess of Nippon’s brave <i>samurai</i>,” I answered,
“it is well to give the gods credit for their share
in the destruction of the Mongol fleet. I have
heard that the larger number of the war junks
were wrecked or foundered in a great typhoon.”</p>

<p>“We will implore the gods to send another
such typhoon,” retorted Keiki.</p>

<p>“The warships of my people are not clumsy
junks,” I replied. “They drive into the teeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
of the storm with no sails set upon their masts.
I have myself twice outridden typhoons in the
black ships.”</p>

<p>“Grant leave, Your Highness, for Mito to
destroy the insolent barbarians!” cried Keiki.</p>

<p>“If my countrymen might know beforehand
that the Mito clan were seeking battle on their
own quarrel and not as representing Nippon,
Your Highness could do no better than to let them
attack,” I said. “The result would provide a
valuable lesson for the other frogs in the well.
My countrymen come in peace, desirous of honorable
friendship with the people of Dai Nippon.
But they are not swordless tradesmen.”</p>

<p>“Nor are the barbarians <i>samurai</i> bred,” retorted
Keiki. “Only five years have passed
since two American warships ventured to approach
Yedo Bay. The report cannot be doubted that
their great <i>tojin</i> lord was flung back into his
boat by a common sailor of Nippon when he
sought to come aboard the ship of the Japanese
commander.”</p>

<p>“The shame of that insult is upon Nippon,”
I said, keeping to my court smile, though my face
burned with hot anger at the jibe. “The august
ruler of America had given strict command that
the people of Nippon should be shown utmost
courtesy and friendliness. The American commander
was urgently asked to come aboard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
junk to receive the letter of His Highness. As a
token of honor to His Highness, he came alongside
the junk and was boarding the vessel when the
outrage occurred. Believing that the insult was
the act of the sailor alone, Commodore Biddle
restrained his just resentment, and left the punishment
of the sailor to the laws of Nippon. We
have a saying that only savages and persons of
low intellect mistake moderation for fear.”</p>

<p>“Woroto speaks wisely,” said the Shogun.
“All have now spoken except Ii Kamon-no-kami.
What has Naosuke to say?”</p>

<p>The <i>daimio</i> between Abe and Keiki bowed
forward to respond. Though a man still under
forty, the intellect and power in his smooth face
was quite sufficient to explain to me the respectful
attention with which all awaited his words.</p>

<p>“Your Highness,” he said, “advice is humbly
offered that too little is now known for final
decision. The counsel of Owari dono and Satsuma
to inquire the purpose of the American
envoy is thought wise,&mdash;no less the counsel of
Midzuano and Keiki to assemble a force of <i>samurai</i>
and artillery against attack. The course of wisdom
is for all parties to unite their strength under
Your Highness.”</p>

<p>“The time has come for all loyal subjects to
join together, forgetful of past enmities,” purred
Midzuano. “It is the time to bind up old wounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
and cover old scars. For the sake of common
preservation, humble request is made that Owari
dono join in petitioning for the freedom of one
who would prove a tower of strength to Nippon,&mdash;the
wise and brave Rekko Prince of Mito.”</p>

<p>The Prince of Owari bowed, with a smile as
suave as the subtle counsellor’s. “It is certain
that Midzuano has at heart only the honor and
glory of His Highness,” he murmured. “Owari
claims a still higher degree of loyalty, if such be
possible. The present moment is one of confusion
and uncertainty. All men respect the counsel
of Ii Kamon-no-kami. He has said that too
little is now known for final decision.”</p>

<p>I saw Keiki blink his narrow lids to hide the
fierce flash of his eyes. Midzuano turned with an
indifferent bearing to look down the chamber.
The Shogun made a slight sign. I glanced about
and saw Gengo creeping forward on his knees,
with a scroll upraised before him on a tray. He
kowtowed and murmured almost inaudibly:
“Report to the Council of Elders from Yezaimon,
Governor of Uraga.”</p>

<p>Iyeyoshi signed him towards Midzuano, who
took the scroll, and at a nod from the Shogun,
read the message aloud.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“To the august Council of Elders: Report is
hereby humbly submitted that shortly after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
midday four warships of the hairy barbarians,
two being of vast size, entered the mouth of the
inner bay and, without sail, proceeded against
wind and tide to an anchorage within close view
of Uraga. Being boarded by the second in command
at Uraga, his request that the black ships
proceed to Nagasaki was peremptorily denied.
Demand was made that all guard-boats be withdrawn.
The barbarian commander is said to
be of such exalted rank that only <i>daimios</i> may be
admitted into his presence. He comes as an
envoy from the <i>tojin</i> country called the United
States of America. He bears a letter from the
ruler of America to His Highness the Shogun,
alleged to contain requests for friendship and
intercourse. Statement is made that if such
letter is not honorably received at Uraga, the
black ships will proceed up the bay and deliver
the letter at Yedo. The American warships
are very powerful and are armed with many
cannon of immense size.</p>

<p class="in0 in6">
“<span class="smcap">Yezaimon</span>, Governor of Uraga.<br />
“<span class="smcap">Nakashima</span>, Vice-governor of Uraga.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>As the reader settled back on his heels and
rolled up the scroll, all turned to the Shogun.
He spoke with quick decision: “The counsel of
Ii Kamon-no-kami is accepted. Let <i>samurais</i> be
assembled by the <i>daimios</i> in command along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
bay, to guard against surprise. To receive the
communication of the ruler of America is against
the ancient edict. So grave a matter as setting
aside the edict requires deliberate consideration.
Let the officials at Uraga negotiate with the
<i>tojin</i> envoy until a decision may be reached by
my counsellors. Permission is given to withdraw.”</p>

<p>We kowtowed and glided from the audience
chamber past an increeping group of chamberlains.
In the anteroom, when I received back my
sword and dirk from the old gate captain, Keiki
eyed him sharply, but was called away by Midzuano.
Ii Kamon-no-kami and Abe Ise-no-kami
followed the Prince, Satsuma, and myself through
another exit, and asked me many politely worded
questions as we clattered along on our high clogs.</p>

<p>Leaving the palace enclosure by one of the
lesser bridges, we crossed the outer enclosure
of the citadel to the Sakaruda Gate through a
small army of grotesquely armored <i>hatamotos</i>.
It was the first time that I had seen Japanese
in full war-harness, and bizarre as was the effect
of their dish helmets, wing-like shoulder brassards,
and the padded robes under their plate and
chain mail, I must confess that they presented
a most formidable appearance even to one
acquainted with modern firearms.</p>

<p>Outside the Sakaruda Gate I was relieved to
find Yoritomo waiting for us with a guard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
half a thousand Owari retainers, all clad in armor
as complete as that of the <i>hatamotos</i>. He himself
wore a wondrous suit of gilded armor that glittered
resplendent in the light of the swaying lanterns.
He rode an armored stallion, but had brought a
<i>norimon</i> for me.</p>

<p>The need of this escort became clear when we
marched away through the official quarter. I
had left the broad streets swarming with a silk-clad
panic-stricken mob. I came back to find
them all but jammed with mailed and helmetted
<i>samurais</i> whose wild fear had given place to the
fury of despair. Many among them,&mdash;for the
most part Mito retainers,&mdash;wore their armor
shrouded with white mourning robes, in token
of devotion to death in battle.</p>

<p>Ii and Abe had turned aside to their <i>yashikis</i>,
which were near at hand, eastward from the gate.
We moved in the opposite direction, and having
escorted Satsuma and his cortege to his <i>yashiki</i>,
finally won our way through the crowded streets
to the outer moat and across into Owari Yashiki.</p>

<p>A few minutes later I was alone in my apartments
with Yoritomo, relating all that had befallen
me since our parting at sunset. Throughout
the account my friend listened with intense
interest, but with no comment except an exclamation
of profound astonishment that the Princess
should have confessed her love to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
When I had quite finished, he shook his head
in a puzzled manner, and said: “In all the temples
and at thousands of <i>samurai</i> garden shrines,
prayers are being made for the gods to send a
great wind against the <i>tojins</i>. If all the <i>tojins</i>
are as favored by the gods as one I know, there
will be no typhoon.”</p>

<p>“I have won the favor of Azai. How can I
fail to possess the favor of the gods?” I replied,
not altogether in jest.</p>

<p>He clanked his golden armor in an impatient
gesture. “<i>Namida!</i> We speak of women and love,
when the fate of Nippon hangs in the balance!
There is one thing you have not told me. What
was the message Yuki handed to you when you
were mounting your horse? He says that a
<i>geisha</i> gave it to him for me. He did not presume
to read it, but as he could not reach my <i>norimon</i>
through the midst of the Satsuma men, he gave
the note to you, not knowing that you cannot
read Japanese.”</p>

<p>I searched in my bosom, and drew out a
crumpled bit of paper. As Yoritomo smoothed it on
the palm of his steel gauntlet, he nodded. “The
writing of Kohana. You are right in suspecting
that the attack in the garden enclosure of the
Princess was not due to chance. It was an ambush
laid by Keiki and Midzuano. They hoped you
would be cut down by the <i>hatamotos</i> as you entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
the citadel. That failing, Gengo deliberately
misled you into the forbidden enclosure of the
women, that Midzuano might set the guards
of the inner gate upon you. The guards did not
know it was a plot. They were loyally seeking
to avenge the outrage committed by one of the
hairy barbarians who had violated the sacred
enclosure of the palace women. None other than
Azai or the Shoguness could have saved you.”</p>

<p>“Kohana’s note!” I exclaimed. “Does it tell
all that?”</p>

<p>“Between the lines, as you say,” he answered;
and he read the writing, “‘Gengo has taken pay
of Keiki.’”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tea with the Tycoon</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">There</span> followed four days of anxious
waiting. Though the Prince went
daily to the palace, my presence
was not commanded, and in the continued
state of public stress and
turmoil, it was thought best that Yoritomo and
I should keep close within the <i>yashiki</i>. The Mito
faction had given wide publication to a garbled
account of our trial, which libelled us with the
stigma of confessed spies. Had we appeared
in the streets of the official quarter before excess
of fury had exhausted the rancor and excitement
of the <i>samurais</i>, we should have been hacked
to pieces by our enemies and their dupes.</p>

<p>Throughout the vast extent of the lower city
the panic continued without cessation. Day and
night the bay-front populace streamed inland by
thousands, bearing upon back and shoulder
their household goods, young children, and aged
mothers. Skirting along the outer moat of the
official quarter, the bulk of the refugees from
the southern half of Yedo poured past Owari
Yashiki in an endless mob, all alike possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
by the one frantic desire to place themselves
beyond reach of the magic <i>tojin</i> cannon.</p>

<p>Yet vast as was the multitude of townsfolk that
poured out of Yedo, fully a third were replaced
by the <i>hatamotos</i> and <i>samurais</i> that rushed in
to the defence of the Shogun’s capitol, while
reports were received that the <i>daimios</i> down
the bay had assembled ten thousand armor-clad
men within the first two days. The clans
were responding to the call of the Shogunate by
lining up to present a solid front to the barbarians.</p>

<p>Had there been confirmation of the first wild
rumor that the black ships numbered sixty and
their guns six hundred, or had Commodore Perry
attempted a forceful landing, the heat of patriotic
loyalty would have fused even the icy venom of
the hatred between Owari and Mito. But the
Commodore, though firm to arrogance, took
utmost care to avoid all acts of violence, and his
squadron was not large enough to awe the Mito
faction into forgetfulness of their desire to overthrow
the Shogunate.</p>

<p>At last, after much debate and intrigue, the
Prince and Satsuma, backed by Ii Kamon-no-kami,
won a denial of the demand of Keiki and
Midzuano for immediate hostilities. The American
envoy having resolutely refused to go to
Nagasaki and having again threatened to ascend
the bay, Iyeyoshi reluctantly appointed two of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
lesser <i>daimios</i> as commissioners to receive the letter
of the President of the United States.</p>

<p>Together with the news of this victory, the
Prince brought from the palace the Shogun’s
command for Yoritomo to break the seclusion
of his mourning and proceed to Uraga. The duty
assigned him was secretly to check the interpreters,
and make a full report of all that occurred during
the ceremony of receiving the <i>tojin</i> letter. He
was forbidden, on pain of death, to enter into
any communication with the barbarians.</p>

<p>This was during the afternoon of July the
eleventh. Yoritomo and I sat up late that night
discussing the situation. He pointed out the
extreme precariousness of my standing as a supposed
<i>tojin</i> spy in the opinion of all who favored
Mito. I replied that with the risk doubled, and
only half my present slender chance of winning
my little Princess, I should still prefer Yedo to
the safety of the warships. He then offered to
smuggle a message from me to the Commodore,
so that the Shogunate might be warned to protect
me from harm. I objected that I did not wish
to be delivered over to my countrymen and taken
out of Japan; that the discovery of such an attempt
to communicate would mean ruin, alike to us and
to his plans; and that I was willing to face the
risk I had brought upon myself by coming to
Japan with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
So it was that my friend set off down the bay the
next morning in one of the swift government
guard-boats, pledged to silence regarding my
presence in Yedo. Had he not given me his
word, all the watchfulness of the dozen <i>hatamoto</i>
attendants and spies who accompanied him would
have failed to prevent his communicating with
Commodore Perry.</p>

<p>His departure, I must confess, left me more
than lonely. The Prince continued to spend
his days at the palace, either opposing Midzuano
and Keiki in private audience, or planning with
the Household to checkmate the intrigues of the
Council and its supporters to bring about an
attack on the black ships.</p>

<p>At last, about noon of the fifteenth, Fujimaro,
my chamberlain, informed me that I was commanded
to appear before the Shogun. An armed
escort was provided for me, with Yuki, now my
swordbearer, in command, and I was borne to
the citadel at a speed that in less strenuous times
would have disgraced the House of Owari. Had
the identity of the <i>norimon’s</i> occupant been
suspected by the war-accoutred <i>samurais</i> who
still thronged the streets of the official quarter,
I doubt whether we should have reached our
destination without a bloody fight.</p>

<p>To avoid such an untimely conflict among the
clans, instructions had been given to admit me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
in my <i>norimon</i>, as on my first visit, through the
Heanzo Gate, at the head of Kojimachi Street.
My guards, with the exception of Yuki and Fujimaro,
were required to wait outside the gate.
Within the bastion my bearers halted and set
down the <i>norimon</i>. I peered out to ask Yuki
the reason for the halt. He had stepped aside,
and in his place I saw Gengo bowing and smiling
with irreproachable suavity.</p>

<p>“Proceed across the garden,” I commanded.</p>

<p>“Pardon, my lord,” murmured the fellow.
“It is required that my lord should descend and
come with me unattended.”</p>

<p>“I have been commanded to appear before
His Highness,” I said. “How can I trust to
the guidance of one who once lost me in a certain
other garden?”</p>

<p>He faced me squarely with no other look than
contrition in his eyes. “My lord covers me with
well-merited shame,” he replied. “Many others
than myself were dazed by the great fear that
fell upon all Yedo that day; yet my lord does
well to reproach me for my stupid blunder.”</p>

<p>“To save you the shame of repeating the error,
I will ride through the garden, as on my first
visit.”</p>

<p>“The gods forbid!” he exclaimed, dropping
on his knees. His voice sank to a faint whisper.
“My lord, it is not permissible&mdash;my lord must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
give over his sword and dirk, and come with me
unattended.”</p>

<p>I smiled. “The pleasure of waiting at deserted
kiosks is not always appreciated.”</p>

<p>“This time there will be no need to wait,”
he whispered. “His Highness is in the garden.
If my lord doubts, let him demand the escort of
the gate captain. But he must leave his <i>norimon</i>,
as I have explained.”</p>

<p>I felt the brace of pistol-butts within my bosom.
This time I had come fully prepared. “Open,”
I called.</p>

<p>Yuki and Fujimaro sprang to assist me from
the <i>norimon</i>. I thrust my feet into the clogs held
by them, and handed over my sword and dirk
to Yuki.</p>

<p>“I am ready,” I said.</p>

<p>The chamberlain started off with a look that
told me he was puzzling to surmise whether I was
a blind fool or a very brave man. Either I had
been too obtuse to suspect his part in the ambush,
or else, knowing his treachery, I was, he supposed,
following him unarmed into another secluded
garden. His open display of perplexity convinced
me that he now had no treachery in mind, else he
would have kept closer control of his expression.</p>

<p>Without a second backward glance, he led the
way at a rapid pace up an avenue of umbrella
pines. Somewhat over a quarter of a mile brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
us to a narrow path that crossed the avenue at
right angles. Gengo turned to the left, up the
new way. I felt of my revolvers, and clattered
after him. He came to a rockery bordered with
dense groves, an ideal place for an ambush. I
stopped short. He went on a few steps, and
pointed around the far side of a huge rock. I
gripped my revolvers and advanced.</p>

<p>Beyond the boulder the rockery opened out
around a little artificial cliff, upon the crest of
which was perched a small summer-house.
Through the latticed end of the building I perceived
a figure in black and yellow robes. I
waved Gengo to lead on. We skirted around
to the right, and came upon half a hundred <i>hatamoto</i>
guards in full war-harness. For a moment
the sight of their flashing lance blades, horned
helmets, and steel mail gave me a lively fright.</p>

<p>I half halted, only to advance again as I saw
that they were making way for me, with respectful
smiles and bows. Gengo passed on through
their midst, and ascended a narrow wooden
stairway that led up the rear of the cliff. Following
close upon his heels, I swung up after him
and around the enclosed end of the building.
Through a small window, a yard or so short of
the second corner, I caught a glimpse of a lady’s
coiffure.</p>

<p>The sight thrilled me with the thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
rapturous possibilities. I hastened around into the
low veranda of the kiosk’s front, dropping my clogs
at the edge in imitation of Gengo. A few steps
more brought us into the presence of the Shogun.
His Highness was seated upon a low divan, with
Owari dono before him on his left, and Satsuma
on his right. As we rose from our salute, Gengo
placed a cushion for me beside the Prince, and
silently withdrew.</p>

<p>The Shogun favored me with a slight relaxation
of his austere frown. “Woroto Sama has displayed
commendable diligence in responding to
our command,” he said.</p>

<p>“The will of Minamoto Iyeyoshi is the pleasure
of those who desire to serve him,” I responded.</p>

<p>Owari and Satsuma exchanged glances approving
the politeness of my phrasing. Iyeyoshi
nodded, and made a sign to the Prince, who drew
forward a small rosewood case richly ornamented
with gold. I saw at a glance that the designs
were not Japanese&mdash;I thrilled at sight of the
well-remembered eagles! From the box the
Prince handed to me an official document written
in English and sealed in gold with the great seal
of the United States of America. I raised the
document to my forehead and kowtowed.</p>

<p>“The letter of the President!” I murmured.</p>

<p>“Translate,” commanded the Shogun, taking
up a paper written in classical Chinese ideographs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
The Prince unrolled a similar paper, while
Satsuma opened a Dutch writing. I perceived
that I had been summoned for the purpose of
cross-checking the translations of Yoritomo and
the official interpreters. I rose to my knees and
began reading the document in my best Japanese:</p>

<p>“‘Millard Fillmore, President of the United
States of America, to his Imperial Majesty, the
Emperor of Japan. Great and good friend&mdash;’”</p>

<p>Iyeyoshi checked me with a gesture. “A difference!
It is here rendered, ‘His Exalted Highness
the Tycoon.’ You say, ‘His Highness the
Shogun.’”</p>

<p>“The error is mine, Your Highness,” I explained.
“The terms may not be translated literally.
Their intent is to express supreme rulership.”</p>

<p>“In such case,” said Satsuma, “Mito may
be expected to claim that the message is addressed
to the Mikado.”</p>

<p>“I regularly received investiture as Shogun
from the Mikado,” replied Iyeyoshi, frowning.
“The rulership of Nippon is in my hands, according
to law and custom. I am not the first Shogun
to be addressed as ‘Tycoon’ and ‘O-gimi.’”</p>

<p>“The letter is properly received by Your Highness,”
observed the Prince. “The Mikados have
chosen to maintain their sacred seclusion for
generation after generation. It is for Your Highness
to defend the domains of the present descendant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
of the Sun Goddess and inaugurate a glorious
cycle for Dai Nippon by opening the land to
enlightenment.”</p>

<p>“The bonds of ancient laws are not to be broken
without deliberate consideration,” replied the
Shogun, and he signed to me to proceed.</p>

<p>I read on slowly through the letter’s courteous
expression of friendship and of desire for commercial
intercourse, the arguments regarding the
mutual advantages of trade, and the need of
protection to the shipwrecked sailors of our
whalers and other ships. At almost every line
I was questioned and cross-questioned, above all
when I came to the suggestion that the laws
might be suspended and intercourse tested as
an experiment for a limited period. This proposal
received the hearty approval of both the
Prince and Satsuma, and they urged its acceptance
upon the Shogun. He asked me numerous questions
about treaties between the Western nations,
and then, without replying to his advisers, commanded
me to proceed.</p>

<p>As I finished the reading and returned the letter
to its case, the Shogun turned upon Satsuma with
a deepening of his frown. “You speak as counsellor
for the barbarians. You have yet to refute
the ten reasons for war set forth in the memorial
of Rekko, Prince of Mito.”</p>

<p>The Daimio took a scroll from his sleeve, opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
it, and ran a finger down the vertical lines of
writing as he spoke his comments: “Your Highness,
it is true that in the past the armies of
Nippon have been victorious in foreign lands,
but the <i>tojins</i> do not come as invaders. It is no
disgrace to enter into honorable treaty with
peaceful envoys.”</p>

<p>“And, possessed of <i>tojin</i> cannon and ships,
Nippon may again win glorious victories in
Korea and China,” added the Prince.</p>

<p>“Regarding the second statement,” went on
Satsuma, “the <i>tojin</i> letter declares that religion
is a matter apart from the policy of the American
Government. There is no intent to force the
doctrines of the evil sect upon us. As to the
question of trading precious goods and metals
for those we do not want, the <i>tojin</i> nations buy
only what they desire and sell what they please.
We can do the same. Mito speaks of the Chinese
Opium War. If we accept the offer of friendly
intercourse, we can learn the ways of the <i>tojin</i>
and acquire skill in their methods of warfare.”</p>

<p>“In one breath Mito says that we are not as
brave and strong as our ancestors, and in the
next urges us to plunge into war with these friendly
envoys,” said Owari. “He defames the brave
<i>samurais</i> who have rushed to the defence of our
shores, and then asks if it is wise to disappoint
their ignorant desire for attack.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
“The interests of Dai Nippon are of greater
moment than the interests of the clans in control
at Nagasaki,” added Satsuma.</p>

<p>“The haughty demeanor of the American
admiral proves that the American Government
has honored Nippon by sending an envoy of exalted
rank,” argued the Prince. “Only the frogs in
the well consider the presence of the black ships
an insult. It is the Mito faction that seeks to
undermine the fear and respect due the Government
of Your Highness. Should such disloyalty
continue, ‘chance to rouse the case-dulled spirit
of our men’ will soon be presented by the need
to chastise the defamers of the Shogunate.”</p>

<p>“Enough,” said Iyeyoshi, relaxing his frown.
“You have replied to the memorial and in part
refuted its statements. Nevertheless, the Daimio
of Kaga and many other powerful clan leaders
support Mito. The black ships soon sail. They
will not return for a long period. We have ample
time to deliberate over our answer to the <i>tojin</i>
ruler. Letters will be sent to all the <i>daimios</i>
and noted officials and counsellors in Dai Nippon,
commanding their advice.”</p>

<p>Satsuma bowed, more pleased, I fancied, than the
Prince. “The proceeding is without precedent,
Your Highness, yet none may doubt that it is
the course of wisdom.”</p>

<p>The Shogun touched a small gong. A screen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
at the inner corner of the veranda slid open, and
O Setsu San kowtowed on the sill-beam. The
Shogun made a sign. The girl withdrew.</p>

<p>“Your Highness,” murmured the Prince.
“Woroto Sama came to Nippon sincerely desirous
of rendering a service of friendship and good
will. Your Highness condescends to favor him,
but Mito seeks his destruction. There is yet
time to send him aboard one of the black ships,
if Your Highness considers his presence in Yedo
unpropitious.”</p>

<p>“Does Woroto wish to join his countrymen?”
demanded the Shogun.</p>

<p>“The Land of the Gods is very pleasant to
me, Your Highness,” I answered. “I do not wish
to go. I desire to remain until death.”</p>

<p>The Shogun gazed at me between doubt and
friendliness. “The prayer of Woroto is granted.
He may remain in Yedo, at least until the return of
the black ships,&mdash;provided he is willing to risk the
consequences should the counsel of Mito prevail.”</p>

<p>I saw a slender figure bowing forward through
the opening in the screens, and a flood of color
leaped into my face.</p>

<p>“Your Highness,” I cried, “I will gladly risk all! I
thank you for your gracious permission to remain!”</p>

<p>The Shogun stared piercingly into my flushed
face; then turned with the Prince and Satsuma
to watch Azai, his face, like theirs, grave almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
to solemnity. With slow and graceful movements
that followed one upon the other with
the precision of a formal ritual, my little Princess
entered with a brazier upon which the charcoal
glowed in a tiny crater of rock crystal. Setting
this before us, she returned to fetch, one at a
time, tongs, kettle, dipper, tea canister, bowls,
and various other tiny utensils.</p>

<p>Throughout the bringing and arranging of
this equipment the profound silence was broken
only by the occasional murmuring of set phrases.
Azai proceeded with utmost grace and delicacy,
too intent upon the correct performance of the tea
ceremony to venture a glance at me. The tea,
crushed into a fine powder, was mixed in a bowl
with boiling water and beaten with a bamboo whisk
that my darling rolled deftly between her fingers.</p>

<p>The first bowlful of the tea porridge was served to
the Shogun upon a tray of unvarnished cypress
wood, which was then set aside. But the bowl
was rinsed and filled with a second mixture,
which was served to the Prince on a gold-lacquered
tray. Again the bowl was rinsed and used to serve
the soup-like tea to Satsuma on the same tray. Last
of all Azai rinsed the bowl and prepared my tea
with the same delicate precision and grace.</p>

<p>When she approached to serve me, I looked
to see her blush or tremble. I was yet to learn
the full measure of a Japanese lady’s self-control.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
Holding the tray on a level with her adorable
little chin, she knelt before me without the slightest
trace of a quiver beneath her gracious smile. The
exquisitely delicate rose tint of her cheeks neither
paled nor deepened. Only once, as I set the
emptied bowl back upon the tray, her lowered
lashes lifted for an instant, to disclose to me a
glimpse of the unfathomable tenderness and love
in the depths of her lustrous eyes.</p>

<p>With the same slowness and solemnity she
drew back and proceeded to carry out the brazier
and service in set order, while her father, the Prince,
and the Daimio noted the last stages of the ritual
with their formal phrases. I sat in the meek attitude
of a neophyte, but I fear I gave little heed to
the solemn ritual. All too soon Azai kowtowed and
disappeared. The quaint rite was at an end.</p>

<p>That she should have come and gone with only
that one glance and never a word for me, went
far to lessen the joy of seeing her. My face was
grave when the Shogun looked down upon me.
He nodded approvingly. “Woroto Sama seems
versed in the pleasant mystery of the tea ceremony.
It is known in his country?”</p>

<p>“I seek to learn, Your Highness. The ceremony
is undeveloped in my country. As yet
the drinking of tea is for the most part confined
to our women.”</p>

<p>The word set loose upon me a flood of questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
with regard to <i>tojin</i> women and marriage. I
answered as best I could. As I anticipated,
Satsuma and the Prince were no less shocked than
the Shogun at the freedom allowed Occidental
women. But I perceived that the severity of
His Highness’s look softened when I dwelt upon
the honor and respect which we accord our wives.
I recalled that statement of Kohana San that
Minamoto Iyeyoshi regarded his daughter with
the fondness due a son.</p>

<p>“It is certain that the <i>tojin</i> peoples reverse
many of the rightful rules of society and morals.
Yet what has been said is of grave interest,”
he observed. “Woroto Sama is doubtless aware
that in Nippon a teacher is held in high honor
as the temporary father of his pupils. The
children of the Sei-i-tai Shogun should not remain
in ignorance of the <i>tojin</i> world.”</p>

<p>I kowtowed to hide my eager delight, and
waited in keen suspense.</p>

<p>“After the American envoy has sailed, your
presence will be required. Until then&mdash;” He
dismissed me with a gesture.</p>

<p>I withdrew to rejoin Gengo, who was waiting
at the corner of the kiosk. As we passed the
window a face appeared within, and I again met
the loving glance of my little Princess.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lessons and Love</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">My</span> impatience over the delay of the
expedition to sail at once may well
be imagined.</p>

<p>At last, on the morning of the
eighteenth, Yoritomo returned home
with the welcome news that the squadron had
weighed anchor and put out to sea the previous
day. He had much to say of the display on
either side when Commodore Perry landed at
Gorihama, below Uraga, and delivered over the
President’s letter to Toda Idzu-no-kami and Ido
Iwami-no-kami. On the following day the black
ships had excited much apprehension by sailing
up the bay almost to within sight of Yedo.</p>

<p>I listened to the account of my countrymen’s
proceedings with an indifference that astonished
me. Thanks to my long intimacy with my friend,
the few weeks of my stay in his country had
sufficed to initiate me into the life and customs
of his people. I was fascinated by the <i>samurai</i>
spirit. Yet for all that, I might well have been
overcome with longing at the news of the departure
of the expedition, had it not been for my love for
the little Princess. Yoritomo had made me a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
friend to the Japanese; Azai made me a Japanese.</p>

<p>True to the Shogun’s word, the official report
of the sailing of the American squadron brought
a prompt command for me to attend upon Iyesada
Sama and Azai Sama as instructor in <i>tojin</i> learning.
The time appointed was early the following
morning.</p>

<p>Half the night was spent listening to the advice
of Yoritomo, who feared that I might lose all
by betraying my love in the presence of others.
In return for my promise to be as discreet as
circumstances would permit, he agreed to lay
the matter before his father and seek to interest
him in my preposterous attempt to win the
Princess.</p>

<p>Armed with the Shogun’s order, I set out at
dawn, travelling incognito but with the full retinue
allowed me by the Prince. On the one side of
my <i>norimon</i> walked Fujimaro, and on the other
Yuki. The latter, now fully recovered from his
wounds and torture, carried himself with the dignified
assurance of the finest swordsman in Yedo.</p>

<p>Through my palanquin window I gazed out
at the splendid fellow with pride. He was my
own personal retainer and not one of the servants
of the House of Owari loaned to me for the occasion.
Legally he was no more a member of the clan
than myself. His family had been enrolled among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
the Owari retainers, but he himself had expressed
a preference to be received into my service. The
Prince had readily agreed to this arrangement,
though not because of any reluctance to accept
among his retainers a <i>ronin</i> who had been
expelled from the service of the Shogun.</p>

<p>Yoritomo had said that it was ill-advised for
me to take the former <i>hatamoto</i> to the palace.
But I felt certain that the Shogun would not
consider the act an affront. Should he so regard
it, I relied upon the excuse of my <i>tojin</i> ignorance
and my need for a personal retainer.</p>

<p>The morning was still fresh when we entered
the citadel by the Sakaruda Gate. Having the
Shogun’s order for passport, I rode through and
did not descend from my <i>norimon</i> until on the point
of crossing one of the inner moats into the palace
grounds. Here I was met by Gengo the chamberlain,
as ever suave to obsequiousness. He did
not relish the entry of his former captain into the
palace, and suggested that Yuki should remain
with the rest of my escort. But with due regard
to my dignity as teacher of the Shogun’s children,
I insisted upon the attendance of both Yuki and
Fujimaro.</p>

<p>My determination won the day. Gengo started
off submissively, and led us through the gardens
of the O Shiro, to the enclosure of the secondary
palace set apart for the use of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
Shogun’s heir. The edifice, though small, was
exquisitely finished in several woods, inlaid in
designs of odd beauty. I would have been quite
willing, however, to forego the pleasure of viewing
the artistic decorations of the waiting room
as well as the enjoyment of the customary refreshment
that was served me. Yet one must needs
cultivate patience if he would dwell among an
Oriental people.</p>

<p>Mid-morning found me still cooling my heels
in the waiting room. At last I suppose the Prince’s
curiosity overcame his inertia. Gengo reappeared,
to conduct me into the presence of the heir
apparent. Yuki and Fujimaro followed me to
the threshold of the audience chamber, where
I signed to Gengo to take my sword and bear
it in for me. He demurred, with the statement
that to carry the sword of a <i>tojin</i> into the presence
of Iyesada Sama was not permissible.</p>

<p>“Very well,” I replied. “Yuki will be my
bearer.”</p>

<p>“Impossible. None other than my lord may
enter.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall carry it in myself. I am here
as the teacher of Iyesada Sama. I demand
the deference due a teacher.”</p>

<p>At this he took the sword from me, and knelt
to enter the chamber of audience. I walked
after him erect. The slowness of our progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
up the long apartment gave me ample time to
observe the place and its occupants. All one
side of the chamber was open upon a fantastic
garden of sand and rocks representing a volcanic
seashore. Its bare, verdureless stretch contrasted
strongly with the richness and ultra-delicacy
of the apartment’s decorations.</p>

<p>My attention quickly centred upon the two
persons seated before the gorgeous <i>tokonoma</i>.
One I recognized as Abe Ise-no-kami, the elder
of the two strange <i>daimios</i> at the Shogun’s conference.
He sat on the left of a young man whose
amiable but weak face answered to Yoritomo’s
descriptions of the epileptic heir apparent.</p>

<p>As I stalked up the room behind the creeping
chamberlain, the Prince and his companion
regarded me with looks of surprise that quickly
deepened to resentment. The <i>tojin</i> was presuming
to swagger into the presence of the Shogun’s
son! But I had planned my course and was
sure of my ground. When within a short distance
of the angry sitters, I paused and gazed at
the Prince in stern reproof.</p>

<p>“Is this the proper manner for a pupil to receive
his teacher?” I demanded. “Can it be that
Iyesada has been misinformed as to the purpose
of my visit?”</p>

<p>The Prince turned to Abe with a look of bewilderment,
as if seeking aid and instruction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
The Daimio rose and signed him to do the
same.</p>

<p>“Woroto Sama is implored to pardon the rudeness,”
he said. “Excuse is offered that he was
not distinctly announced as a teacher.”</p>

<p>I glanced down at the stooped figure of Gengo.</p>

<p>“The offence is forgotten. Mistakes occur even
with the best of intentions. I have come at the
command of the Shogun to instruct his son in
<i>tojin</i> learning.”</p>

<p>Abe whispered a few words to the Prince, who
promptly stepped away from his seat, and waved
me to it with a graceful bow.</p>

<p>“My honorable teacher is entreated to repose
himself,” he murmured, in a voice so like his
sister’s as to startle me.</p>

<p>I contrived to maintain my dignity, and seated
myself in the place of honor, with my sword at
my right hand. As Gengo withdrew, the Prince
seated himself on my left, between me and Abe.
After an exchange of bows and formal greetings,
I at once entered upon my duties by inquiring
the Prince’s knowledge of the outside world.
It proved to be scant and vague, yet gave me a
basis upon which to build.</p>

<p>As a beginning, I gave a brief explanation of
the earth’s relation to the solar system. This,
though quickly grasped by Abe, seemed beyond the
comprehension of the Prince, who complained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
that so strange a statement could not be reconciled
to the facts that Ama-terasu the Sun Goddess
had come down to Dai Nippon, and that Dai
Nippon, the centre of the universe, rested upon
the back of the great fish.</p>

<p>When I sought to argue the matter, the Prince
became excited and insisted upon the truth of
his myths with childish petulance. Abe intervened,
with tactful diplomacy, and I, perceiving
the weakness of the Prince’s mind, waived the
dispute, and sought to divert the attention of
my pupil with descriptions of <i>tojin</i> costume and
architecture.</p>

<p>This proved to be as successful as my first attempt
had been unfortunate. Iyesada at once grew
tranquil and exhibited the utmost curiosity over the
absurdities of the hairy barbarians. I illustrated
my descriptions with sketches, which the Prince
copied with remarkable facility and precision.</p>

<p>Had I given way to the desire of my pupil,
I should have continued with him all day. But
I had not come to the palace to waste all my time
on this unfortunate epileptic. At the end of
two hours I informed him that it was time to close
the lesson. When he demurred, with a quick
return of petulance, I stated that it was inadvisable
to teach him more at this time, since I wished
him to reduce to writing all the information he
had received.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
Abe gravely commended my plan of instruction,
and the Prince at once deferred to his companion.
I withdrew, having taught my pupil a few valuable
facts along with a mass of inconsequential chaff,
and having learned in turn that he was a capricious
weakling, very much under the influence of the
quiet Abe Ise-no-kami.</p>

<p>With Gengo again for guide, we left the Prince’s
enclosure and crossed over into another walled
subdivision of the citadel. Though I did not
recognize it as the garden in which I had met
the Princess, the failure may have been due to
an approach from an opposite direction. Enough
for me that I was being conducted to my adorable
little darling.</p>

<p>This time there was no delay. Yuki and
Fujimaro were left in an anteroom, and I was
conducted to the seat of honor in the adjoining
reception chamber. The room, which was decorated
with elegant simplicity, overlooked a miniature
landscape garden of rocks and ferns and
dwarfed trees.</p>

<p>Hardly had Gengo withdrawn to the anteroom
when a side screen drew aside to admit a dozen
or more demure and graceful <i>samurai</i> ladies.
They ranged themselves along the side of the
room, midway down, and kowtowed to me. As
I nodded with the austerity becoming a <i>daimio</i>
in the presence of women, O Setsu San entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
and knelt. Close after appeared my little Princess,
smiling yet demure, composed yet graciously
eager to welcome her august teacher.</p>

<p>Softly she glided out past her ladies-in-waiting
and sank down before me with her white forehead
upon the mat. “Ten thousand felicitous years
to my Lord Woroto!” she murmured.</p>

<p>“The good wish of Azai Sama is acknowledged,”
I replied. “The august lady is requested to seat
herself at the left hand of her teacher.”</p>

<p>“Pardon, my lord, but it is not permissible
for a woman to sit in the presence of one so vastly
above her.”</p>

<p>“Let two boxes of this height be brought,”
I ordered, holding my hand at the height of a
chair.</p>

<p>O Setsu San glided out, and returned in a few
moments with a pair of lacquered cases about
the size of tea chests. I signed her to set them
down near the side of the room that faced the
garden.</p>

<p>“As teacher of the <i>tojin</i> learning and customs,”
I explained, “I will begin by showing the Princess
the <i>tojin</i> etiquette practised between a gentleman
and a lady. The Princess will be pleased to act
as directed.”</p>

<p>I rose and offered her my hand. “May I
have the pleasure of assisting you to rise?”</p>

<p>Azai glanced up at me with a startled look.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
I smiled. “The august lady is to take my hand,
and say, ‘You are very kind.’”</p>

<p>“You are very kind, my lord!” she whispered,
and half averting her head, she entrusted one of
her tiny hands to me.</p>

<p>I drew her up, stepped back, and swept her a
bow in Occidental style. “Permit me to conduct
you to a seat.”</p>

<p>She looked at me in a puzzled manner, and I
explained with utmost gravity: “You will bow&mdash;no,
not to the floor, only a little more than I. In
this fashion&mdash;so! that is better. Now place the
fingers of one hand upon my arm.”</p>

<p>The tips of her fingers touched the silk sleeve
of my proffered arm with the lightness of a perching
butterfly. I escorted her to the nearest chest,
bowed, and turned back for a cushion. Placing
it upon the chest, I took her hand and assisted
her to seat herself, facing the garden. But
when I drew the other chest nearer and was about
to sit, she stopped me with a quick little cry,
and fluttered back to fetch me my cushion from
before the <i>tokonoma</i>. As she knelt to place it
on my chest I looked down at her with well-feigned
severity.</p>

<p>“The august lady forgets that she is receiving
a lesson.”</p>

<p>“Pardon, my lord! But could I permit my
august teacher to seat himself without his cushion?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
“The august lady will remember that she is
receiving a lesson in <i>tojin</i> etiquette. Among
my people the gentleman always attends upon
the lady.”</p>

<p>So preposterous a reversal of all the rules of
propriety compelled the bevy of ladies across the
room from us to murmur in astonishment. But
Azai meekly permitted me to assist her again to
her seat. Before seating myself I assumed my
austere manner and sought to forestall criticism
by another explanation: “The august lady is now
to converse freely, as to an equal, on music and
art and flower arrangements and the amusements
permitted young ladies.”</p>

<p>I glanced across at the ladies-in-waiting. Quickly
as they lowered their eyes, I caught their stare of
mingled curiosity, wonder, and merriment. Only
Setsu was regarding me with a frown. She was
not pleased with the game I was playing in the
face of all present and perhaps of some not present.
It is easy to make a peep-hole through a paper
screen.</p>

<p>But I had gone too far to withdraw. I seated
myself, and, with a wave of my hand towards
the garden, murmured ardently: “Azai! we must
make gestures and pretend to be talking of flowers
and art, but you know what my heart burns to
say to you!”</p>

<p>“My lord! Love is surely a gift of the gods!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
All these days I have been wrapped about as it
were in a dream of wonder and delight! How is
it possible that so low and mean a creature as I
can be loved by my lord?”</p>

<p>“Is an angel a low or mean creature? Little
Princess, because you are in the world, the sun
is bright, the moon silvery. The stars twinkle
with joy when you smile up into the gloomy sky.
I have no need to see the cherry blossoms of
Nippon&mdash;I have seen you! When you speak
I fancy the nightingale is singing!”</p>

<p>“My lord,” she whispered, “such praise is as far
above my worthlessness as the sun above the abyss.
May Kwannon grant me the joy of serving my lord
for the space of seven existences!”</p>

<p>“For all time, Azai&mdash;we shall be linked together
in mutual love and service! We are fated to be
united throughout eternity.”</p>

<p>“My lord!” she murmured, and she turned
to bend to me, her dark eyes beaming with unutterable
love and devotion.</p>

<p>“Look to the front!” I warned her, and again
I pointed to the garden as if remarking upon one
of the dwarfed trees. She recovered her composure
on the instant. Yet I perceived that the
situation was more difficult than I had the right
to require of her. I turned to the rear and
remarked: “Among my people it is customary
for ladies to entertain visitors with music.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
Azai turned about also, and made a sign to
Setsu. The girl went out with a companion and
brought in a <i>koto</i>, an instrument resembling a
large horizontal harp or zithern. This was an
agreeable surprise to me. So far I had heard
only the <i>samisens</i> of the <i>geisha</i>, and their notes
are particularly discordant to Occidental ears.</p>

<p>Now I was to hear the instrument of the <i>samurai</i>
ladies, played by none other than Azai herself.
She adjusted the ivory plectrums upon her plump
little fingers and, kneeling beside the <i>koto</i>, began
to play. Though mostly in the minor key and
full of quick transitions that were often discordant
to me, her music had many passages of plaintive
sweetness. My enjoyment may have been due
in part to the personality of the player, for the
Occidental ear is not attuned to Oriental music.
Yet the <i>koto</i> is certainly far more harmonious
than the twanging <i>samisen</i>.</p>

<p>When the Princess finished playing, I called
for writing materials, and attempted by means
of words and drawings to describe the harpsichord
and pianoforte. I used one of the chests as a
table for drawing my figures, and it was necessary
for Azai to kneel across from me that she might
bend near enough to follow the lines I drew to
illustrate my explanations. It was natural that
our glances should meet. I saw my soul in her
sweet eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
In the midst, one of the wall screens at the foot
of the room was flung open, and Gengo the
chamberlain entered, insolently erect.</p>

<p>“His Highness the Tycoon commands the
presence of the <i>tojin</i>,” he announced.</p>

<p>“Kwannon!” gasped Azai, and she sprang up
to interpose her slender figure between me and
the chamberlain. “My lord&mdash;I fear! Should
it mean&mdash;the worst&mdash;I will rejoin my lord!”</p>

<p>“Not that&mdash;not that!” I protested.</p>

<p>“Without my lord I could not live! If my
lord goes from this life, I will follow!”</p>

<p>Her eyes glowed up into mine with that light
of utter devotion. If I died, she also would die.
There was no hope of dissuading her. I bowed
in formal leave. She kowtowed with her ladies.
I advanced to Gengo and passed out without
a backward glance.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ensnared</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">In</span> the anteroom my austerity subdued Gengo
to his usual obsequiousness. He bowed
low before my glance, and ushered me out
with the utmost deference. But as we
recrossed into the enclosure of the main
palace he halted and signed to Yuki and Fujimaro
to turn aside.</p>

<p>“Rejoin your fellow-retainers,” he commanded.</p>

<p>“No. Follow me,” I interposed.</p>

<p>“It is not permissible,” stated the chamberlain.</p>

<p>“It was permissible when I came with the
Prince of Owari.”</p>

<p>“The <i>tojin sama</i> is not Owari dono.”</p>

<p>“The Shogun has summoned me. My attendants
accompany me to the waiting room. Lead
on.”</p>

<p>Again my stern composure overcame his servile
nature. He led us through the garden to one of
the side entrances of the palace. In the first
room three other officials appeared and called
upon my attendants to halt. Fujimaro and Yuki
stopped and kowtowed. I gave over my sword
and dirk to Yuki, and proceeded with Gengo
and one of the other officials.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
Hastening along a broad corridor, we soon
came to a room full of armed guards, who
crouched in a peculiar posture, with hands on their
swordhilts, as though about to leap up. The
room was without screens along the hall, but
was closed on the side adjoining the Shogun’s
audience chamber, into which the corridor opened
a few paces farther on. At the threshold the
second official halted. Gengo kowtowed and
began to crawl up the mats of the audience hall.</p>

<p>The Shogun was seated on a low dais, behind
which a group of guards crouched in the same
posture as those in the anteroom. Before the
Shogun, on the right, knelt five officials. Of
these, the nearest one to the dais was Midzuano
Echizen-no-kami, from which I inferred that the
four others were his fellow-members of the Council
of Elders. All turned and stared at me as I
stalked up the chamber after Gengo. But the
Shogun sat with eyes downcast, contemplating
the fan which he held unopened upon his lap.</p>

<p>Several mats short of the dais Gengo kowtowed
and drew aside. I advanced much nearer, kowtowed,
and rose to my knees to face the Shogun.
My heart sank. His gloomy eyes were fixed upon
me in a menacing stare. It was evident that he
was greatly angered at me, and Midzuano was
present to spur him on to extremes. I contrived
to smile and utter a courtier’s phrase: “Your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
Highness has commanded. The <i>tojin</i> hastens
to render service.”</p>

<p>“The <i>tojin</i> is ill advised to use the word
‘service,’” rejoined the Shogun harshly. “It
is said that Woroto has taken into his service
Yuki the <i>ronin</i>. Such an act cannot be regarded
other than as a reflection upon my justice.”</p>

<p>“Your Highness,” I replied, “it is the glory
of Japanese justice that deeds are considered in
the light of motives and circumstances. Doubtless
the members of the august Elder Council
have sought to persuade Your Highness that I
made Yuki my swordbearer with the deliberate
intent to affront the Sei-i-tai Shogun. In such
matters, Your Highness, certain classes of the
<i>tojin</i> peoples are very plain-spoken. On my honor
as a man of highest birth among my people, I
say that if such an allegation has been made,
it is a malicious lie and slander.”</p>

<p>“The <i>tojin</i> speaks with an excess of heat,”
murmured the Chief Counsellor. “Let him give
proof that he is slandered.”</p>

<p>“First let my defamer give proof of the charge
against me,” I retorted.</p>

<p>“You do not deny having taken the <i>ronin</i>
into your service,” said the Shogun.</p>

<p>“In the midst of my trial before the High
Court, Your Highness, the Daimio of Satsuma
interposed to save Yuki from further torture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
and honored him with a priceless gift. Does
Midzuano charge the Daimio with affronting
Your Highness?”</p>

<p>“The Lord of Satsuma did not take the <i>ronin</i>
into his service.”</p>

<p>“For the reason, Your Highness, that I spoke
first. Ask the Daimio if he does not regret his delay.
Yet any thought of aspersion upon the justice
of Your Highness was as far from my mind
as from the Daimio’s. And in justice to a most
loyal subject, I must declare that among all the
<i>hatamotos</i> there is none truer than Yuki. In
the hour of humiliation the brave man bowed to the
justice of his lord without a murmur. So devoted
was his loyalty that he endured torture rather
than testify against those who had saved the
daughter of Your Highness from <i>ronin</i> capture.”</p>

<p>The Shogun bent towards me with sudden
deepening of his frown. “Insolent barbarian!
do you dare speak of your artifice?”</p>

<p>“My artifice, Your Highness?”</p>

<p>“Can you deny that the attack of the <i>ronins</i>
was a prearranged plot by which you and Yoritomo
profited?” demanded Midzuano.</p>

<p>The subtle intriguer was actually charging us
with the villainy of his own party. The sudden
springing of the snare caused me to hesitate.</p>

<p>“Answer!” cried the Shogun. “You and your
accomplices knew beforehand of the plot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
“We knew beforehand that Keiki had plotted
the attack&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Keiki?”</p>

<p>“He set the Mito <i>ronins</i> upon the cortege of
the Princess, expecting to rescue her at the last
moment, and so gain the favor of Your Highness.”</p>

<p>“Did I not foretell to Your Highness that they
would seek to divert the charge of guilt from themselves
by some such incredible tale?” murmured
the Chief Counsellor. “Keiki Sama did not
appear until after the massacre. But this <i>tojin</i>
and his fellow-spy followed the cortege in disguise
from beyond the outer moat. If they knew
beforehand of the intended attack and were
innocent of complicity, why did they not warn
the cortege?”</p>

<p>To refute such subtleness was beyond me.
The best I could do was to assume a bold front.</p>

<p>“As a kinsman of Owari, I do not choose to
answer the queries of the partisan of Mito,”
I declared.</p>

<p>“Not even to explain why you held off until
the <i>ronins</i> had slaughtered the <i>hatamotos</i>, and why
the <i>ronins</i> fled before two men when they had
slain a score?” interrogated Midzuano.</p>

<p>“Give me a sword and confront me with a
Mito partisan in full armor,” I rejoined. “One
reason for the fleeing of the <i>ronins</i> will shortly
be made apparent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
“Enough of the <i>ronin</i> attack and of Yuki the
<i>ronin</i>,” said the Shogun. “There remains a matter
that more nearly concerns my honor. Gengo
will repeat his account of the outrageous conduct
of the <i>tojin</i> in the palace of the Princess.”</p>

<p>I flushed crimson with rage. The treacherous
chamberlain had stolen out during my instruction
of Azai, to aid Midzuano in setting this snare
for my destruction. I met the gaze of the Shogun
with a look as angry as his own, and said with
deliberate reproof: “In my land men of noble
blood do not publicly discuss matters concerning
ladies.”</p>

<p>He made a sign with his fan, and commanded:
“All others than Midzuano will withdraw beyond
earshot.”</p>

<p>“The matter is between Your Highness and
myself,” I said. “My life is in the hand of
Minamoto Iyeyoshi. Rather than speak in the
presence of a third person, I am prepared to die
without benefit of medicine.”</p>

<p>The Shogun again signed with his fan. Midzuano
rose to his knees and shuffled away after
the others. I was left alone in front of the dais,
still too angry to flinch before the Shogun’s frown
and the menace of his eyes.</p>

<p>“Your Highness has condemned me without
a hearing,” I charged. “Is that the boasted
justice of Dai Nippon?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
“Such insolence is of itself worthy of death!”
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Your Highness,” I replied, “I come of a family
so proud that it is a degradation for me to kowtow
even before the exalted ruler of Nippon, yet my
desire to serve has caused me to humble myself.”</p>

<p>“The rudeness of the <i>tojin</i> might be forgiven
on the plea of his ignorance. Not so an insult
to the Princess my daughter.”</p>

<p>“Your Highness has listened to the lying tales
of my enemies. I would sooner strike off my right
hand than insult the Princess Azai. Your Highness
does ill to heed the malicious slanders of
those who condemned me on false charges and
who, when baffled by the command of Your
Highness, laid an ambush for me in the garden
of the Princess.”</p>

<p>“In the garden of the Princess!&mdash;ambush!” he
repeated.</p>

<p>“Upon the first day of the panic,” I said, and
I gave him a concise account of all that had
occurred from the interruption of my passage to
Owari Yashiki by Gengo to my rescue by the
Princess on the bridge.</p>

<p>“<i>Namida!</i>” he muttered, when I came to a pause.
“I cannot put to torture a man whom she saved.”</p>

<p>“Your Highness,” I replied, hastening to take
advantage of this betrayal of tenderness, “the
happiness of a child is one of the fondest wishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
of a parent. I ask permission to speak openly,
after the manner of my people.”</p>

<p>He studied me for some moments, between
curiosity and rankling anger. Curiosity won.
“Speak according to the manner of your people,”
he commanded.</p>

<p>I bowed. “Let Your Highness bear in mind
that whatever I say, though contrary to Japanese
etiquette, is spoken with utmost deference and
respect for yourself and the Princess Azai.”</p>

<p>“Speak,” he repeated, masking his anger behind
an inscrutable calm.</p>

<p>“In the first place,” I began, “Your Highness
should know that Yoritomo Sama, my friend
and brother in spirit, has vowed to enter the
monastery of Zozoji. Your Highness may recall
the statement of Azai Sama, made upon the
occasion of my first audience with Your Highness.
In the chief temple of Shiba, below the image of
the Goddess of Mercy, was where the Princess
and I first gazed into each other’s eyes.”</p>

<p>The Shogun started, and a threatening flash
shot from his sombre eyes. But again he masked
all feeling behind a look of inquisitorial coldness.</p>

<p>I continued: “Is it an error to believe that my
meetings with the august lady have been guided
by a higher cause than human will or blind chance?
As I have said, we first saw one another before
Kwannon, in the sanctuary of the temple. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
second meeting was in the midst of battle and
slaughter; the third in the presence of Your
Highness, when I was received as the kinsman
of Owari dono and as a <i>daimio</i> of the first class;
the fourth in her garden, when she saved me from
the treacherous plot of my enemies&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Proof is yet to be made that either Keiki or
Midzuano knew of the attack. You have yourself
stated Gengo’s claim that he was confused
by reason of the great terror which lay upon all.
The gate watch had only to discover your presence
in the forbidden enclosure, to charge upon you.”</p>

<p>“I have presented the facts so far as I know
them, Your Highness. What I now wish to make
clear is how Fate has brought together myself
and the august lady. Twice Your Highness
called upon your daughter to serve the <i>tojin</i>
guest. It cannot be that Your Highness failed
to perceive that her soul shone in my eyes&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<i>Namida!</i>” he broke in. “For far less presumption
men have been sawn asunder&mdash;crucified!&mdash;burned!”</p>

<p>“Is the presumption so great when consideration
is taken of the honor accorded me by Your
Highness? As the acknowledged peer of the
Prince of Owari and the Daimio of Satsuma&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hairy barbarian!” he flung at me.</p>

<p>“Your Highness has read the memorial of
Yoritomo Sama,” I replied. “My people are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
as vastly above your people in some respects as
your people are above mine in others. Another
matter&mdash;who may say whence our souls come
and whither they go? My friend Yoritomo contends
that the august lady and I must have loved
one another in a previous incarnation. This I
do not know, but I do know that I have seen my
soul in the eyes of the Princess.”</p>

<p>His face darkened with a sudden return of anger,
but his voice was constrained to a false calmness:
“It is now perceived that the <i>tojin</i> is a madman.
Permission is granted him to withdraw.”</p>

<p>“Your Highness!” I protested. “The happiness
of the Princess&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Her happiness and honor will be safe in the
keeping of her husband. She shall wed Keiki,
the son of Mito.”</p>

<p>“Keiki?” I cried. “The man who sought to
disgrace her?”</p>

<p>“Does the <i>tojin</i> still hold to that lie? Enough!
His punishment will be considered, and command
sent in due time.&mdash;Go!”</p>

<p>There was no hope for me in the cold menace
of his look. Yet I did not give way to any outward
display of the fear and despair that was
within me. Sustained by the pride of race and
blood, I forced a smile, and kowtowed and withdrew,
complying with the most punctilious requirements
of court etiquette.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hara-Kiri</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Not</span> until I stood in my own apartments
in Owari Yashiki, alone with
Yoritomo, did I give way to the
tempest within my soul. Even then
the frailness of the walls compelled
me to speak with lowered voice, but my pent-up
rage and despair vented themselves in a flood
of bitter complaint. Never had I seen my friend
so concerned. Yet it was the outcome he had
predicted, and he could give me no hope.</p>

<p>“I grieve for you, Worth,” he said. “You
have learned the truth. The remotest suggestion
of your desire would seem madness to Iyeyoshi.”</p>

<p>“But she loves me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The daughters of <i>daimios</i> and shoguns are
presumed not to love until after marriage. Your
statement to him that she loved you was most
unfortunate. Even a <i>samurai</i> of the lowest rank
would consider such a declaration an aspersion
upon his family honor. Had it not been for that&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Tomo! I have played into the
hands of your enemies&mdash;I have endangered all
your plans! The tyrant will not stop at punishing
me. He will wreak his anger upon those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
have harbored the hated <i>tojin</i>. I shall leave
Owari Yashiki at once and turn <i>ronin</i>, taking
with me Yuki. Neither of us shall continue to
bring danger upon the House of Owari.”</p>

<p>For some moments he sat silent, regarding me
with a smile of womanly tenderness. When he
replied he spoke as if quoting from the Chinese
classics: “Far better is death in the consciousness
of honor than a grovelling prosperity. The laws
of hospitality are sacred: they may not be violated.
A house that cannot stand upright should
fall.”</p>

<p>“The House of Owari bears the weight of the
contest against Mito,” I argued. “The enemies
of Owari seek to use the harboring of the <i>tojin</i>
as a lever to overthrow the real friends of Nippon.”</p>

<p>“It is of no avail, Worth,” he said. “Your
sacrifice would result in no good. If we are not
strong enough to shelter you, we are not strong
enough to resist Mito. The matter is in my hands,
not yours. Let writing materials be brought.”</p>

<p>“What would you do?” I demanded, seized
with a premonition of his purpose.</p>

<p>He smiled almost gayly. “The time has come
for me to give myself for the success of my mission.”</p>

<p>“Tomo,” I cried, “not that! not that!”</p>

<p>“What is death?” he argued. “A passing
from blind form to unhampered spirit; a freeing
of the bonds of earthly desire. Other and higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
incarnations await him who has sought to overcome
self.”</p>

<p>“Tomo, I have brought you to this fearful
thought&mdash;I can never forgive myself!”</p>

<p>“You have nothing to forgive, Worth. You
are in no manner responsible for what I am about
to do. That was determined upon by me before I so
much as saw your ship in Kagoshima Bay. How
often have I told you that my life has been vowed?”</p>

<p>“Yet it might not have been required! It is
my selfishness that is forcing you to this dreadful
decision. At the best I am a condemned man.
It is my right to do what little I can to free the
House of Owari from blame.”</p>

<p>“The House of Owari stands or falls in honor.
To thrust you out as a <i>ronin</i> would stain that
honor, and it would rightfully be considered
as evidence of weakness. No, brother! There
is one chance, and only one, to check the intrigues
of Mito.”</p>

<p>I shuddered. “So dreadful a death, Tomo!
Could I but take your place!”</p>

<p>“I am <i>samurai</i> bred. It is a privilege to offer
one’s life in a great cause. You, I fear, will have
the harder task. I shall ask you to perform for
me the service of best friend.”</p>

<p>“You mean&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“You will act as my chief second in the
ceremony.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
“No! no!” I cried, quivering with horror.
“If you cannot be turned from your dreadful
sacrifice, let Yuki&mdash;but I&mdash;the very thought&mdash;my
God!”</p>

<p>“Yuki is your retainer. I will accept him as
my inferior second. You are my friend and equal.
I ask you to perform the highest office of friendship.”</p>

<p>“No!” I protested. “The very thought is
too terrible! I cannot endure it.”</p>

<p>“The chief second is not always required to
act,” he said. “I may have the fortitude to
dispense with assistance. Will you not render me
this great service of friendship? It is the custom.
You will win the gratitude of my father, the
grateful respect of the Owari clansmen. Promise
me the favor.”</p>

<p>“Tomo! you know how abhorrent to all my
Western ideas&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is the highest office of friendship. My
brother, you admire the <i>samurai</i> spirit because
it is in your blood. No <i>samurai</i> will flinch when
duty demands. You are my friend, my kinsman.
You will serve me, Worth! With my sword in
your hands, I will undertake the ceremony certain
of an honorable outcome. Remember, you are
now a son of Dai Nippon.”</p>

<p>“You insist?&mdash;Good God!”</p>

<p>“In honor to your dearest friend&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
“I am only a <i>tojin</i>. They will call my service
a dishonor.”</p>

<p>“You have been received by Iyeyoshi as the
equal of Satsuma. I have no other friend. Will
you fail me in my need?”</p>

<p>“My God!” I cried. “How can I?”</p>

<p>“I speak only of friendship. I will not urge
your assent on the ground of consideration for
my father. For the sake of Dai Nippon, I went
out into your <i>tojin</i> world and returned to die.
You chose to return with me, brother. Will
you now forsake me in my need?”</p>

<p>Suddenly the veil of horror parted before me,
and I saw the intended sacrifice with the eyes
of my friend. Iyeyoshi had been duped by the
wiles of the reactionaries. The Mito party, if
not quickly checkmated, would turn the Shogunate
against all progress and greet the American expedition
upon its return with an attack no less vicious
than futile. After that, war and reprisals; bombardments
by the black ships, rebellion, internecine
war, and a weakened Government; harsh
demands by the domineering <i>tojin</i> powers&mdash;possibly
a conquest!</p>

<p>What more inspiring than the thought that
all might be averted by the giving of one life?
My friend was about to offer himself as a willing
sacrifice for the good of his country. It was my
privilege to ease the ordeal for him and to lend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
an added dignity to the ceremony. What did
it matter if my Occidental prejudices were shocked
and horrified at the part required of me? To the
Japanese it was an almost sacred duty. He had
well said that it was the highest service a man
could render a friend.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;will serve&mdash;you, Tomo!” I gasped.</p>

<p>He sprang up, beaming. “There is no time to
lose. Send Yuki to Shinagawa for Kohana. I
must see my father and prepare a declaratory
testament to be presented to the Shogun. Fujimaro
will make all the necessary arrangements.
Until the time comes, brother&mdash;”</p>

<p>He turned to go, but I sprang before him to
grasp his hand. “Tomo! must it really be?
Is there no other way?”</p>

<p>“Your sorrow is my sole regret,” he replied.
“All others whom I love will rejoice with me in
my deed.”</p>

<p>To this I had no reply. He gave my hand a
responsive grip, and hastened out. I sank down,
overcome with a wave of returning grief and
horror. But he had said there was need for haste.
I sat up and clapped sharply for Fujimaro and
Yuki. They entered and bowed to receive my
urgent commands. Yuki rushed out to ride posthaste
to Shinagawa, Fujimaro to make arrangements
for the ceremony of <i>hara-kiri</i>. I was left
alone with my anguish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
Twilight approached. My attendants came
with lamps and the evening meal. I could not
eat, and I dared not refresh myself with <i>sake</i>.
There was need for me to retain perfect control
of mind and body. I could do nothing but
suffer and wait for the terrible moment, hiding
my pain as best I could behind a mask of austerity.</p>

<p>At last Yuki came to announce his return with
Kohana San. I ordered the <i>geisha</i> brought in
and Yoritomo notified. As the girl kowtowed
before me I saw by her pallor that she had been
told. Yet she had the fortitude to smile and
murmur the usual complimentary greetings. Only
once I caught her gaze and read in her agonized
eyes the grief and despair which etiquette compelled
her to conceal.</p>

<p>Soon Yoritomo entered, gravely serene, yet
radiant with the solemn joy of self-sacrifice. His
final testament was in the hands of his father.
All was now in readiness for him to undergo
the ultimate test of sincerity. When he seated
himself beside me Kohana prostrated herself
at his feet. He regarded her with the tender
compassion of a saint for a suffering child.</p>

<p>“Kohana is of <i>samurai</i> blood,” he said. “She
knows that death is a small matter.”</p>

<p>“The servant implores the honorable joy of
following her lord!” she murmured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
“Greater service is asked,” he replied. “Those
whom I leave behind may still profit by the
craft of Kohana.”</p>

<p>“Must I then linger?” she sobbed. The weakness
was only of a moment’s duration. She
looked up, her face bright with the same glory of
self-sacrifice that shone in the serene countenance
of my friend. “The will of my lord is the joy
of his servant!”</p>

<p>Yuki kowtowed to me and whispered: “My lord,
now is our time for purification.”</p>

<p>I rose and followed him to the bath, leaving
Yoritomo and his beloved to say their farewells
alone. When we returned, purified by the water
and attired in ceremonial costume of <i>hakama</i>
trousers and hempen winged jackets, I found
my visitors gone. In their place Fujimaro waited
to hand me my friend’s sword. The time had
almost come.</p>

<p>To make certain of my part, I asked a number
of questions and agreed upon a signal from Yuki.
Fujimaro then led us to the wing of the palace
in which a chamber had been set apart for the
ceremony. In the centre of the room the mats
were covered with a spread of white silk, upon
which in turn were laid two red quilts. At each
corner of the quilts stood a single whitewood
candlestick with its hollow-wick taper. The only
other lights in the room were two candles beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
a pair of bench-like seats, five or six paces distant
from the quilts.</p>

<p>Chancing to glance behind a set of white folding
screens that stood across from the seats, I saw my
friend’s dirk lying upon a tray of unvarnished
cypress wood. There were other objects beside
the tray. I looked hastily away. Having assured
ourselves that all was in readiness, Yuki and I
went out into a side room, and waited.</p>

<p>We heard soft footsteps in the chamber. After
a few minutes Yoritomo came down a corridor,
accompanied by several chamberlains. He had
already taken leave of his father and mother,
and was dressed in the prescribed ceremonial
costume of white linen. Kohana had gone, and
the Prince did not appear. Fujimaro entered
and together with the other chamberlains kowtowed
while Yuki and I conducted our principal
into the chamber.</p>

<p>We found the witnesses to the ceremony seated
upon the benches. Great as was my anguish,
I thrilled with momentary pleasure when I recognized
Ii Kamon-no-kami and the great Daimio
of Satsuma. Not even Mito might doubt the
testimony of such witnesses.</p>

<p>Yuki kowtowed. Yoritomo and I bowed low,
and the <i>daimios</i> rose to return the salute. The
<i>daimios</i> resumed their seats. Yoritomo seated
himself on knees and heels in the centre of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
quilts, facing so that the witnesses were before
him on his left. I took up my position behind
him and drew his sword as Fujimaro had directed
me. Yuki brought the tray with the dirk from
behind the screen, and knelt to present it.</p>

<p>Yoritomo bowed to the <i>daimios</i>, loosened his
robes, and took the dirk from the tray. Yuki
kowtowed in a position that enabled him to watch
the fatal stroke and give me the signal. Yoritomo
tucked the ends of his sleeves under his knees,
that his body might not fall backward.</p>

<p>I stood in my place, rigid with horror. Fortunately
I could not see his face or the frightful
stroke. That at least I was spared. All I saw
was the dear form of my friend bending over
under the agony&mdash;to fail him now would mean
a prolongation of his atrocious pain, possibly
the fearful disgrace of an outcry&mdash;Yuki signed
to me. I struck. Never had I aimed a truer
blow!</p>

<p>The next I knew I was holding my sleeve before
my eyes, and some one was leading me from the
chamber of death.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hovering Hawks</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">All</span> night I lay tossing in the anguish of
my grief, unable to sleep and forget.
Morning found me distraught and
fast losing my senses in the delirium
of fever.</p>

<p>When I reawakened to consciousness I found
myself in a large room that opened upon an entrancing
view of the <i>yashiki</i> gardens. There had been
a heavy rain, and a flood of morning sun rays
were streaming through the gray clouds to scintillate
among the foliage with iridescent splendors.
This, I believe, was what had roused me. I
turned my head for a better look, and discovered
that I was strangely weak. Then I remembered,
and I no longer saw the magic glory of the gem-flashing
garden. I groaned and sank back upon
my silken quilts.</p>

<p>Gentle fingers stroked my forehead. I opened
my eyes and gazed up into the soft eyes of
the quaintly beautiful little lady Tokiwa&mdash;his
mother! How could she endure the sight of him
who had held the sword!&mdash;Again I groaned and
closed my eyes.</p>

<p>A man’s voice murmured a prayer for me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
give heed. I looked up and saw a benevolent
old man with huge grotesque eyes. He bent
forward tremulously, and I perceived that the
supposed eyes were Chinese goggles. He kowtowed
and, quivering and sweating with fear,
offered me a bowl of medicine. I took a sip of
the nauseating draught, and thrust the bowl
from me in violent loathing. The physician drew
back before my angry gesture, gray with fear.</p>

<p>“It is required that the august lord should
receive treatment,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“It is my mind, not my body, that is sick,”
I rejoined. “Go!”</p>

<p>He crept away in trembling obedience. The
Princess Tokiwa bent over me to stroke my forehead
with her soothing fingers. I shrank from
her touch and threw my arm across my eyes.</p>

<p>“August lady,” I cried, “how can you bear to
come near the <i>tojin</i>?&mdash;Forgive me!”</p>

<p>“Forgive?” she asked, in evident wonderment.
“Not forgiveness but gratitude is due the august
lord. The House of Owari is the debtor of
Woroto Sama.”</p>

<p>I stared at her incredulously. Was it possible
that even she could feel gratitude towards the
man who had held the sword? She was his
mother!&mdash;Yet I could not mistake the expression
of her gentle face. It is not alone the men of
Nippon’s nobility who are <i>samurai</i> bred. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
was profound grief in the depths of her dark
eyes, but it was a grief crowned with the glory
of her son’s heroic martyrdom, and in her sight
I was illumined by the reflection of his glory.
In the realization of that fact my conscience was
appeased. The terrible feeling of blood-guilt
passed from me and I was healed.</p>

<p>“August lady,” I whispered, “the customs of
the <i>tojin</i> world are far different from the customs
of Dai Nippon. I served my friend according to
his wish. It has made me a Japanese.”</p>

<p>She beamed upon me with a radiant smile,
utterly unconscious of my real meaning.</p>

<p>“Is not Woroto Sama a kinsman of Owari?”
she murmured. “Though he came from beyond
the seas, he has proved that he is <i>samurai</i> bred.
No longer will the clan of Owari think of him as
a man of <i>tojin</i> birth.”</p>

<p>“It is true, august lady. I am now Japanese.
The country of my brother Yoritomo is now my
country, and his mission is my mission.” I sat
up. “See! My strength returns at the very
thought. Let Yuki be sent to me. He and I
have alike incurred the displeasure of the Shogun.
We will become <i>ronins</i>.”</p>

<p>“Is the august lord angered that he would
shame the hospitality of Owari?” she protested.</p>

<p>“I have brought danger upon the family of
my friend and kinsman!” was my answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
She rose and glided from the room. I turned
to creep to a rack upon which my clothes were
hanging, but when I began dressing myself I
found that I could hardly stand. Trailing my
girdle behind me, I tottered back to my bed and
sank down upon it. Before I could recover
sufficient energy to finish my dressing, the Prince
entered and seated himself close beside me.</p>

<p>When we had exchanged salutes, he regarded
me gravely and asked: “Has my guest been
affronted that he should wish to leave my roof?”</p>

<p>“The presence of the <i>tojin</i> threatens the House
of Owari with disaster.”</p>

<p>“Should Iyeyoshi command the punishment of
my guest, I must submit. Otherwise I would
sooner cast out my grandson than permit my guest
to go from my gate a <i>ronin</i>.”</p>

<p>“What is my life against the winning of that
for which a far more precious life has been given?”</p>

<p>“The honor of Owari forbids,” he replied, in a
tone of finality that checked all further protest.
His manner softened to the familiarity of a father
addressing a son. “Woroto may not be aware
of the time that has elapsed since he fell
sick. The last writing of one who has gone from
us has been presented to the Shogun, and the
witnesses have given their evidence of the proof
of sincerity. The welfare of his friend and kinsman
was not forgotten by the testator.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
“He mentioned me in so solemn a document?”
I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Your fate and the fate of Nippon together
await the decision of Iyeyoshi. To-morrow is
the funeral. After that I go to the palace.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow?” I murmured. “Have I lain
here so long?”</p>

<p>“There have been no delays,” he answered.
“You will wish to accompany the cortege to
Uyeno. You must now eat and sleep, that your
strength may return.”</p>

<p>He withdrew, and presently Tokiwa Sama
entered bearing a tray of nourishing food prepared
by her own hands. I ate, and sank into a refreshing
sleep. At nightfall she roused me for a second
meal, and after a time I again fell asleep. At
dawn I wakened hungry and much restored in
strength.</p>

<p>Fujimaro appeared to conduct me to my bath,
from which I returned to find a dainty breakfast
that had been sent by Tokiwa Sama. While
I was eating Yuki came in from a night trip to
Shinagawa. He had made it on the pretence of a
carousal, but in reality to spy upon the Mito
<i>samurais</i> and to ascertain whether all was well
with Kohana. The girl had returned home the
night of Yoritomo’s death.</p>

<p>Yuki learned that her visit had been made without
detection by our enemies. Not only was she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
safe,&mdash;she had gained some information. Yuki
brought from her a message of warning, which
Fujimaro read for me: “The way of the departed
winds past the eyrie of falcons. The seabird
should keep to his nest.”</p>

<p>“The Superior Mito Yashiki lies on the road
to Uyeno,” explained Yuki.</p>

<p>“They would not dare to desecrate the funeral
cortege by an attack?” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“What Mito does not dare is yet to be seen.
My lord and his escort will wear steel within
their linen robes,” said Yuki, and he hastened out
to fetch me a mail cuirass and a cap-like helmet,
while Fujimaro brought me a mourning costume
of white linen.</p>

<p>Leaving me to the chamberlain, Yuki withdrew
to prepare himself and my retinue against treacherous
attack. I was dressed and conducted by Fujimaro
to a room in which I had often honored the
ancestors of Owari by bowing to the Shinto god-shelf.
But the shelf and its tablets were now
hidden by a curtain of white paper.</p>

<p>We passed on into the chamber where the dead
lay before the lighted candles of the Buddhist
family shrine. Neither the Prince nor the Princess
were present. I was received by the chief
mourner, a grave and decorous-mannered boy of
twelve, the son of Yoritomo’s elder brother. I
had expected to see the square coffin or great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
red urn in which, as a rule, persons of noble rank
are buried. But my friend was recumbent in
a long lacquered case, the head of which was
placed to the north.</p>

<p>A napkin lay across his neck. The serene
smile on the face was so characteristic that I
could have fancied he was asleep had it not been
for the vermilion with which the coffin was in
great part filled. The chamber was crowded
with friends and relatives of the family, but I
saw none of them. I looked at my dearest friend,
and drew back to kneel among the other mourners,
my eyes dim with the starting tears.</p>

<p>My arrival had been late. A Buddhist priest
with a little bell entered. After a brief ceremony
<i>etas</i> came in to bear out the corpse. None other
than a pariah might touch the dead. All passed
out into the open and formed the funeral cortege,
led by the priest with his bell and next a boy
carrying the <i>ihai</i>, or memorial tablet, of the
deceased. All the men followed with the chief
mourner, bearing flowers and symbolic banners.
The coffin was borne after us on the shoulders of
the <i>etas</i> in the reversed position of a <i>norimon</i>.
Last of all came the women mourners.</p>

<p>The procession was very long. Before the
rear left Owari Yashiki, the van was far outstretched
on the causeway that led along the
bank of the outer moat towards Mito Yashiki.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
Slowly and solemnly we paced along the deserted
roadway, beside the still waters in which marvellous
lotus blossoms reared aloft their great
blue-green pads. A mile brought us to the
bridge across the Yodogawa where it flows into
the moat.</p>

<p>The causeway now turned with the moat from
northeast to east and skirted the long walls of
Mito Yashiki. Yuki and his men pressed up
close beside me, and grasped their swords within
the white robes. But the <i>yashiki</i> seemed as
deserted as was the street before the funeral
cortege of the son of Owari. Not a face appeared
at one of all the long row of grated windows.
The great gates were closed, and no warder peered
from the porter’s window.</p>

<p>We passed by in a solemn silence broken only
by the tinkle of the priest’s bell and the scuffle
of heavy sandals. The Mito men had respected
the dead, not, I surmised, through any desire
to honor Owari, but because an attack on the
cortege would have been considered little less
than sacrilegious by the other clans.</p>

<p>With no thought of danger to divert me from
grief, the long march on to Uyeno seemed to drag
out to dreary infinity. Yet at last we passed
up the wide Hirokoji Street and through the
Black Gate of Uyeno. Park and mortuary chapels
and monasteries were not unlike those of Shiba,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
and the great temple of To-yei-zan hardly less
grand than Zozoji. But I had no heart for such
wonders as the vast stone lantern and vaster
bronze Buddha, the myriad-handed image of
Kwannon, and the beautiful paintings, arabesques,
and sculptures of gates and ceilings. The tombs
and temples of shoguns were nothing to me.
I was looking upon the coffin of my friend.</p>

<p>When the gorgeously robed priests had ended
their chanted ritual, I rose in turn with the other
mourners, to bow before the coffin and lay incense
upon the smoking censer and withdraw to my
place. When all had taken the last farewell, the
<i>etas</i> bore him into the tomb.</p>

<p>“My lord,” murmured Yuki, “it is ill advised
for us to linger. We should return without delay
to the outer moat, and cross over through the
official quarter. To repass Mito Yashiki would
be to incur great risk.”</p>

<p>“What!” I demanded. “Are we to skulk from
our enemies on our return from <i>his</i> funeral? Let
others do as they choose. We return as we came.”</p>

<p>His eyes flashed with martial fire. “My lord
speaks as a true <i>samurai</i>! His attendants will
go with him gladly.”</p>

<p>“The hawks poise. Do not go, my lord,”
whispered a voice behind me.</p>

<p>“Kohana!” I exclaimed, and I turned about
swiftly. I saw her slender figure gliding in amongst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
a group of the women mourners. In a moment
I had lost sight of her. Yuki sprang to overtake
her, but I stopped him with a gesture.</p>

<p>“Come,” I said. “Let the hawks swoop. They
will find heron beaks awaiting them.”</p>

<p>Fifty men, all mail-clad under their white
robes, followed me out through the Black Gate
and down Hirokoji Street. Our sandals were
bound on tight, and we swung along at a brisk
road pace that promised to carry us past Mito
Yashiki a good half-hour before sundown. We
had no wish either to slip by unseen or to be
ambushed in the dark.</p>

<p>The quickness of our return did not take the
Mito men by surprise. They had watchmen in
a tower at the corner of the <i>yashiki</i>, who signalled
our approach. When we came opposite the great
gate it was open, and Keiki stood in the entrance
with a band of Mito and Hitotsubashi retainers,
all in full armor. Keiki shone resplendent in a
grotesque harness of green and red and gold that
gave him the appearance of an iridescent-scaled
insect. His helmet closed across his face in a
hideous mask.</p>

<p>Keiki’s swordbearer clanked out into the roadway
to intercept us, his mail apron lending to
his gait a ludicrous appearance of waddling.
But there was nothing ludicrous in his purpose.
Yuki sprang before me and exchanged a formal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
bow with the challenger. A moment later their
swords flashed out. Yuki was the first swordsman
of Yedo, but his opponent was a close
second.</p>

<p>For a long two minutes their swords clashed
in terrific blows, stroke upon stroke, with lightning
swiftness. One of the shoulder-brassards of the
challenger fell clanging on the hard ground,
shorn off by Yuki’s blade. In turn Yuki’s mail
barely saved him from a half-parried blow. Had
he worn no armor he must have been killed by
that master cut. Twice they wounded one another
with frightful slashes that shore through brass
and steel and silk wadding to the flesh, yet each
time failed to maim or kill.</p>

<p>The crest of the challenger’s helmet was a
pear-shaped ornament. At the height of the
combat the man stooped forward with the force
of a supreme stroke. Yuki glanced the whistling
blade, and struck back a tremendous downward
blow that split the pear in half and cleft down
through the helmet. The challenger fell as if
struck by a thunderbolt.</p>

<p>My men raised a jeering shout, but Keiki
advanced alone, and they fell silent again. The
young lord strutted out within a few paces of me,
and called tauntingly: “Does the barbarian consider
the day ill-omened for Hitotsubashi? If
so, let him take the place of his <i>ronin</i> dog.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
“There is a <i>tojin</i> saying that meets the situation,”
I replied. “It is to the effect that any
cur may be expected to yap before his own kennel.
Mito Yashiki swarms with retainers ready to
pour out and overwhelm my small band. Keiki
and his followers are in full armor. I refuse to
be tricked. If I draw sword, it means death
to me, whether or not Keiki dies first. Such
being the scheme, I will even the odds in this
manner”&mdash;I drew both my revolvers&mdash;“the
life of Keiki is in my hand. He will do well to
let the mourners of Yoritomo Sama pass in peace.”</p>

<p>The uplifting muzzles of my heavy pistols were
arguments to convince the most sceptical. He
drew back three or four paces. I signed to my men
to march on, but Yuki waited beside me. When
the rear had passed, we turned our backs upon
Keiki and swung away after the others. Keiki
and his men watched us go, without uttering a
word or attempting a single hostile movement,
though the champion of Mito lay outstretched
in the public highway and his blood called for
vengeance upon Owari.</p>

<p>“The hawks have darted upon the heron beaks&mdash;and
swooped back to their eyrie!” I exclaimed.
“You are not seriously hurt, Yuki?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, my lord.”</p>

<p>“Not yet?”</p>

<p>He glanced up at the high, barred windows of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
the <i>yashiki</i>, from which helmeted heads were
peering down upon us. I looked back at the
gate. Keiki and his men were withdrawing into
the <i>yashiki</i>. There was something ominous in
their quick retreat and in the silence of the out-peering
retainers at the windows. I called upon
the men to hasten. They swung into a half
trot.</p>

<p>A barbed arrow whistled past my cheek and
across Yuki’s shoulder. Another struck my breast
and fell blunted from my mail. Yuki sprang to
my right side with upraised sword.</p>

<p>“Run!” he shouted. “The long hawks swoop!”</p>

<p>He clipped a whirring shaft in mid-air with a
dexterous stroke, and dragged me forward into
the midst of the men. A storm of arrows burst
upon us, streaming down through the barred
windows. We broke into headlong flight. Beyond
the farther corner of the <i>yashiki</i> was safety,
and the distance was not great. But the barbed
shafts flew thick and fast. Had it not been for
our armor I doubt if a single one of us would have
won through.</p>

<p>A man beside me plunged backward, struck
through the throat. I would have paused, but
Yuki dragged me onward. The man was dead.
We, too, would be slain if we lingered. More
than once Yuki clipped in the air arrows that
might have pierced between my steel collar and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
helmet. Other arrows bruised my flesh through
steel and padding. I was the central object of
the cowardly attack. The tempered steel of my
<i>daimio</i> armor alone saved me from death. Another
of my men fell dead, and several were wounded
by shafts, many of which were intended for myself.
We rushed on up the road, each wounded man
between two of his fellows.</p>

<p>We passed the corner of the <i>yashiki</i>. The
deadly shower was slackening. A bolt-headed
arrow pierced my upper left arm from the rear.
Yuki sprang behind to shield me with his body.
But it was the last shot.</p>

<p>As, a little farther on, we checked our flight,
Yuki said with grim humor: “My lord now knows
what hawks were meant by Kohana. They
have made us pay two men for one. It was well
the Mito men did not think sooner of the armor-piercing
arrows, else my lord would have been
riddled.”</p>

<p>Without pausing in his stride, he snapped the
arrow that had passed half through my arm, and
drew the end from the wound, and a minute later
it was tightly bandaged. The other wounded men
received the same rough, efficient surgery, but one
died in the very gateway of Owari Yashiki.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII&mdash;<span class="smcap">Son by Adoption</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">Dawn</span> of the following day found the
Prince of Owari at the palace, to
make complaint against the dastardly
attack of the Mito men.
He returned shortly after noon, and
within the hour sent word that he would come to
see me in my apartments. Fujimaro, who brought
the message, knew nothing as to the result of
the visit to the Shogun.</p>

<p>The mingled dread and half-hearted hope with
which I awaited the Prince may well be imagined.
Was I to be sentenced to a horrible death, or
merely sent out of the country? Had Yoritomo’s
sacrifice won against suspicion and reaction, or
were Owari and the cause of progress to go down
to ruin and destruction with myself? Since I
had lost my little Princess, I could think of my
own fate with a degree of indifference. But that
the cause for which my dear friend had given his
life should fail&mdash;what bitterness!</p>

<p>The Prince entered with austere stateliness,
only to drop from the formal to the familiar at
the first view of my bandaged arm. He waved all
our attendants to leave, and sank down beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
me, with a look of kindly concern. “You are
in pain! Your arm&mdash;did Yuki say whether the
arrow had a poisoned head?”</p>

<p>“No, no, my lord. The wound is already
healing. I feel no pain from that. The Shogun!
Tell me!&mdash;Does the House of Owari still stand
unshaken?”</p>

<p>“As firmly as Fuji-yama.”</p>

<p>“And the schemes of Mito?”</p>

<p>He smiled and stroked his slender white beard.
“Rekko continues to dwell in his Inferior Yashiki.
Keiki has paid a heavy price for the pierced arm
of my guest. An attack with deadly weapons
within the bounds of Yedo is an outrage upon the
dignity of the Shogun.”</p>

<p>“His Highness once more inclines to your
counsel?”</p>

<p>“The offering of him who has gone from us has
not been without avail, and Keiki’s false move
has forced the last bar of the gate for us. Your
offence is pardoned.”</p>

<p>“That is small matter. Has there been an
acceptance of policies memorialized by the departed?”</p>

<p>“Many <i>daimios</i> have yet to present their answers
to the letters of inquiry sent out by the Shogunate.
The majority may be against intercourse with
the <i>tojin</i> peoples, yet Satsuma and Ii have joined
me in urging a temporary treaty for the opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
of a few ports. When all answers have been
received, His Highness will command the Council
of Elders to announce the acceptance of our
policy.”</p>

<p>“<i>Banzai!</i>” I cried. “Let intercourse be established
for a time, and even the frogs in the well
will be compelled to see light.”</p>

<p>“The talk of a temporary treaty is a compromise
to bring over those who waver between the two
camps. I have talked too much with you and
with him who has gone to doubt now that ports
once opened will ever be closed.” He looked at
me with a quizzical smile. “Once a <i>tojin</i> enters,
it is difficult to be rid of him.”</p>

<p>“You say I am forgiven?”</p>

<p>“One way has been suggested to rid the land
from the <i>tojin</i>. That is to make him not a <i>tojin</i>.”</p>

<p>“Not a <i>tojin</i>? You mean death!”</p>

<p>“Death to <i>tojin</i> kin and country. I recalled
to the Shogun the precedent of the wise <i>tojin</i>
Anjin Sama.”</p>

<p>“That! Can I also become a Japanese?”</p>

<p>“If you wed a Japanese wife.”</p>

<p>“Wed?&mdash;I cannot do that! You know there
is only one maiden in all Japan&mdash;in all the
world!”</p>

<p>“It is true that the maiden to whom you refer
cannot be given to any other than one of exalted
rank.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
“And I can wed none other.”</p>

<p>“The heart of Iyeyoshi has been troubled.
He questioned the maiden, and found that the
words of the <i>tojin</i> were true. Yet how could
the Sei-i-tai Shogun give his daughter to a <i>tojin</i>?”</p>

<p>I stared at the Prince, aflame with an ardent
hope that overpowered me. “He&mdash;you say that
he&mdash;Speak!”</p>

<p>“The heir of Owari is a fitting husband for the
daughter of the Shogun. You know the arrangement
regarding him who has gone from us. There
now remains only the son of his elder brother.
I have long since reached the age when it is customary
to lay aside the burden of the title and of the
clan administration. The boy is too young.
In such cases it is not unusual to adopt an elder
son to bear the burden of the title until such time
as it is thought best for him to retire in favor of
the younger heir.”</p>

<p>“My lord!” I gasped, “you cannot mean&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Iyeyoshi’s heart is touched by the grief of
his daughter. He is willing to do so much to
assure her happiness. My kinsman guest has a
true heart&mdash;he is to be trusted. When an heir
succeeds during the lifetime of his father, he bends
to the guidance of the retired <i>daimio</i>. There is
no more to be said. The decision is now with
Woroto.”</p>

<p>I kowtowed to him. For several moments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
I could not speak, for I was utterly overcome
with the great joy and unable to believe that
such good fortune could be mine. The serene
face of Yoritomo appeared before my mental
vision. It was as if he had returned to serve
me as guardian spirit.</p>

<p>“Father of my brother!&mdash;my father!” I murmured.
I could say no more.</p>

<p>“Woroto&mdash;my son!”</p>

<p>I looked up and saw his haughty eyes glistening
with tears. We gazed deep into one another’s
souls. My brother had gone from me, but I had
found a father.</p>

<p>He rose and left me.</p>

<p>Soon, however, the screens parted to admit
that sweetest and quaintest and dearest of dames,
Tokiwa Sama. She glided across to kowtow to me,
demurely radiant. I had found not only a father,
but a mother&mdash;and such a mother! Could I
but have gathered her up in my arms and poured
out my heart to her!</p>

<p>Instead we talked with decorous restraint
of various little details of home life,&mdash;matters
trifling and altogether inconsequential in themselves
yet charged with a world of meaning to
me. I was received into the intimacy of the
home life; I had become a member of the family.</p>

<p>Never had I chafed more at the convention
that forbade all reference to romantic love. Freed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
from that taboo, pronounced by an over-rigid
etiquette, I knew my dainty little adopted mother
would have been an ideal confidante. Her dear
face glowed with sympathy and love, which,
being unable to express in words or caresses, she
could convey to me only by looks and the exquisite
courtesy of her manner.</p>

<p>So it was, I was accepted as the son and heir of
Owari in the hearts of my second parents, before
my adoption according to the forms of the law.
The legal adoption was not a simple affair of
routine, as I had fancied. Though proposed by
the Shogun himself, it was blocked for some
weeks by the intrigues of the Mito party and the
opposition of the Elder Council. Unaware of the
motive behind the Shogun’s supposed caprice,&mdash;a
motive that made resistance futile,&mdash;our enemies
worked zealously to prevent the acceptance of
the barbarian as heir of one of the August Three
Families.</p>

<p>In the end our opponents even went so far as
to appeal to that mysterious superlord the Mikado.
For this act custom would have justified Iyeyoshi
in punishing them with utmost severity. But
he was not averse to showing them that the power
of the Shogun, their master, over the Kyoto court
was unbroken, and so the matter was delayed for
some weeks. In ordinary circumstances, the dense
ignorance and bigotry of the imperial court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
regarding the <i>tojin</i> world would have insured a
certain verdict against me. But the Shogun
brought heavy pressure to bear. It was a difficult
matter to deny the express desire of one who had
the power to enforce compliance. Also I suspect
that the difficulty was glossed over by a flat denial
of my <i>tojin</i> blood and a strong insistence upon my
kinship to the House of Owari.</p>

<p>Pending the sanction of the Mikado, I was
required to remain within the bounds of the
<i>yashiki</i>. But it was a confinement far from irksome
in view of the extreme sultriness of the midsummer
weather and the charm of the <i>yashiki</i> gardens.</p>

<p>Yuki, however, roved at will about the city in
the disguise of a <i>ronin</i>, spying upon the Mito men.
Soon after the funeral I had sent him to Shinagawa
with a message for Kohana San. But the <i>geisha</i>
had not been seen since my glimpse of her at Uyeno.
She had not returned to her home, and was not
to be found. Our first thought was that she might
have killed herself for love of Yoritomo. Yet
this seemed improbable when we recalled to mind
his command for her to live and serve those whom
he left behind.</p>

<p>At last, during the solemn Festival of the Dead,
which was celebrated in mid August, Yuki learned
that the girl was a prisoner in Hitotsubashi Yashiki.
Keiki had lured her into his palace, and had either
induced or forced her to become one of the many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
concubines allowed a high noble by custom and
law. From this last, Yuki reasoned that Keiki
could not possibly have discovered her devotion
to our cause, else she would surely have been
tortured, instead of being honored with the rank
of concubine. When I expressed my surprise
that her love for Yoritomo had not caused her
to commit <i>hara-kiri</i>, Yuki was no less surprised
that I had failed to grasp her motive. For love
of her dead lord, she had submitted to a fate that
to her was worse than death.</p>

<p>“With the permission of my lord,” he added,
“I will continue to haunt the vicinity of Keiki’s
<i>yashiki</i>. None is more crafty than a <i>geisha</i>.
She will be watching for an opportunity to send
us word of the schemes and intrigues of the Mito
party.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII&mdash;<span class="smcap">High Treason</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> day after Yuki’s discovery, word
at last came from Kyoto, sanctioning
the Prince of Owari’s adoption of his
kinsman as son and heir. After that,
little time was required to comply
with law and custom. The opposition of the Mito
faction was paralyzed by the sanction of the
Mikado. It was a striking instance of the paradoxical
nature of the government of this strange
land.</p>

<p>In theory, the Mikado was the sacred and
absolute Emperor, and the Shogun only the first
among his secondary class of nobles. In fact,
he was little more than a figurehead in the hands
of the Shogunate, and his sanction of government
measures was usually given as a matter of course.
A strong Shogun, such as Iyeyoshi, could even
enforce compliance against the wishes of so powerful
an opposition as the Mito party backed by
the reluctance of the <i>kuge</i>, or Kyoto nobles. Yet
without the Mikado’s sanction, however obtained,
the Shogun would have become a rebel, with no
other means than sheer military force to hold in
subjection the great non-Tokugawa <i>daimios</i>.</p>

<p>One may well imagine the chagrin of the Mito<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
faction over their failure to block my official
adoption as the heir of Owari, and their fury when
they learned of the Prince’s retirement in my favor.
Last of all, the discovery that the Shogun was about
to announce his decision in favor of a temporary
treaty with the hairy barbarians must have goaded
them to madness.</p>

<p>The final ceremony of my accession to the title
and position of Prince of Owari was an audience
by the Shogun. Before this, in the presence of
the counsellors and other high officials of the clan,&mdash;many
of whom had journeyed from the Province
of Owari for the occasion,&mdash;my adopted father
had abdicated his office of clan chief, and I had
received the homage of the <i>samurais</i>. The day
appointed for my formal audience was August
the twenty-fifth.</p>

<p>Though surfeited with the irksome etiquette
and honors of my exalted rank, I looked forward
to the audience with keenest impatience. The
Prince&mdash;as I shall continue to call him&mdash;had
assured me that it was the last step in my elevation,
and vastly more important than my marriage.
To me it was important only because it must
precede my marriage.</p>

<p>As a necessary result of the ascent that brought
me within reach of my silvery moon,&mdash;my all
but unattainable Princess,&mdash;I could endure and
even welcome the austere state of my exalted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
position. Of itself, however, there was no relish
to me in the homage of my clan, and far less in
the thought of rendering homage to my lord the
Shogun. My princely rank was a ceremonial
strait-jacket which bound me about with countless
rules of etiquette and restricted my every act
and word to certain prescribed forms. To a man
who was not to the manner born, the result was
little short of torture.</p>

<p>Yet I would gladly have endured even greater
discomfort for the sake of winning Azai. The
vision of her pure and lovely face was before my
eyes night and day. It sustained me throughout
the dreary hours of ceremonies, and appeared
beside the serene face of Yoritomo when I made
the required offerings and prayers before the
memorial tablets of the family shrines.</p>

<p>At last the day appointed for my audience
arrived. I was roused long before dawn, and my
little lady mother herself came to overlook every
detail of my costume. By dawn my lantern-illumined
cortege, marching with all the solemn
parade of a state progress, had crossed the official
quarter to the Sakaruda Gate.</p>

<p>With me were the clan counsellors and a powerful
guard of retainers in full armor. Yuki had
reported too fully upon the virulent wrath of
the Mito men for us to chance an attack unprepared.
But Yuki was not with me, though I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
had chosen him to lead my escort. I was concerned
for his safety, for he had gone out on
another of his spying ventures, and had not
returned when expected.</p>

<p>At the Sakaruda Gate those of my escort who
wore armor remained outside the citadel. I was
carried through in my <i>norimon</i>, accompanied by
my counsellors and chamberlains, my standard
bearers, and other ceremonial attendants with
led-horses and paraphernalia. But when we
arrived before the Gejo Gate, the state entrance
to the Inner Castle, I was required to leave my
<i>norimon</i> and cross the bridge of the inner moat
afoot, escorted only by a few of my highest retainers.
The Abbot of Zozoji, who was a prince of
the Mikado’s family, alone could ride in through
the Gejo Gate. That honor was denied even the
heads of the August Three Families, the highest
of all the <i>daimios</i>.</p>

<p>Within the gate I crossed a court to the grand
portico of the palace, where I was met by Gengo
and another of the court chamberlains. Even
my counsellors kowtowed to these servants of
the Shogun, who in turn kowtowed to me. Trailing
their court trousers behind them, they conducted
me to a waiting-room, where I was served
with powdered tea gruel, and attired in court hat,
gauze-winged jacket, and seven-foot court trousers
of yellow silk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
After the refreshment, I left my attendants and
was conducted by Gengo and his fellow chamberlain
along a hall lined with kowtowing retainers, and
past an anteroom in which five or six score <i>daimios</i>
of the lower rank knelt in profound silence.
Shortly beyond we came to the raised threshold
of the audience hall. My ushers kowtowed and
crept in on hands and knees. I followed in the
same abject posture. It was the custom of the
country and the price I must pay for Azai.</p>

<p>The throne was a square lacquered stool,
placed upon a dais two feet high. Though the
Shogun was dressed with no more richness than
on the occasions of my informal audiences, the
stateliness of his appearance was vastly increased
by this simple throne and the mat curtain that
hung down before him to the level of his bell-shaped
hat. On his left, three or four yards down
the room, kowtowed Midzuano and the other
members of the Elder Council. Behind the dais
a number of <i>hatamotos</i> knelt with their hands upon
their swordhilts as if in the act of springing up to
attack me.</p>

<p>At the prescribed distance from the throne my
ushers parted for me to creep forward between
them and kowtow in homage to my lord. The
hush was oppressive. I waited, prostrate, until a
faint sibilation from the courtiers told me that
the Shogun had given the signal for my withdrawal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
My audience was at an end. Without raising
my head, I crept around and out the way I had
come, in the wake of my abject ushers.</p>

<p>Upon my return to the waiting-room I was
served a banquet of nearly a hundred dishes.
I could do no more than taste my favorite dish
of each course, after which all were set aside by
the attendants, to be taken to Owari Yashiki.
An hour passed, and my solitary feast was fairly
under way, when Gengo entered and bowed before
me, with a flask of <i>sake</i> held above his forehead.</p>

<p>“From the Tycoon to the Prince of Owari,”
he murmured.</p>

<p>I kowtowed. “Humble thanks are offered for
the gift of the august ruler!&mdash;Let the wine be
heated.”</p>

<p>“It is the wish of His Highness that the Prince
test the flavor of the <i>sake</i> both cold and hot,”
replied the chamberlain, as he handed the flask
to an attendant.</p>

<p>I bowed assent. “The will of His Highness
is the pleasure&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stay, my lord!” called a voice in the entrance.
“Cold <i>sake</i> is not always wholesome.”</p>

<p>At the first word I had glanced down the room
and perceived Yuki standing erect on the threshold.
The attendants stared about at him, no less
astonished than myself. His dress was disarranged,
and his look so strange that at first I thought he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
had been over-drinking. Fujimaro spoke to him
warningly, and he sank down to kowtow. No
drunken man could have saluted in such manner.
The truth flashed upon me.</p>

<p>“Approach,” I commanded. “You bring a
message?”</p>

<p>He sprang up, with a sharp exclamation: “Look!
The fox has gone!”</p>

<p>I looked about, and saw that Gengo had disappeared.
In the moment’s pause when all eyes
were fixed upon the kneeling Yuki, the chamberlain
had glided to the side wall and slipped out. Yuki
came swiftly up the room through the midst of
the palace attendants, and pointed to the man with
the flask of <i>sake</i>.</p>

<p>“Do not open the flask!” he commanded, and
he knelt to offer me a tattered, crumpled scroll.
“The <i>geisha</i>, my lord&mdash;To the Shogun! Demand
that Gengo drink this <i>sake</i>!”</p>

<p>I bent forward to whisper a question: “You
suspect poison?”</p>

<p>“Not alone for my lord! Hasten! I fear
the worst! Keiki and Midzuano&mdash;Gengo the
tool&mdash;”</p>

<p>But I was already up and crossing the room.</p>

<p>“Bring the <i>sake</i> flask!” I commanded. “Conduct
me to the Shogun. I must see the Shogun
at once!”</p>

<p>Some of the attendants murmured protests.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
But their superior had caught the alarm. He
signed to the man with the <i>sake</i> flask, and led us
swiftly out into the corridor and up it past the
audience hall. The Shogun had retired to more
private apartments. We hastened on through a
suite of rooms. Suddenly a palace guard blocked
our way. My escort whispered to him excitedly.
The guard stepped aside.</p>

<p>We entered an anteroom and glided hastily
across through the midst of the waiting attendants.
At the upper wall we were again halted, while my
request for an immediate audience was sent in to
the Shogun. I waited in an agony of suspense.
One moment after another dragged past. Unable
to endure the uncertainty, I thrust my finger
through the screen, and peered in. The official
to whom my request had been whispered still
crouched on the opposite side of the screen, waiting
for the Shogun’s signal to advance.</p>

<p>I stared up the room to where Iyeyoshi sat at ease
between Midzuano and the Daimio of Satsuma.
As I looked, Gengo glided in with a tea bowl upon
a tray, and knelt to present the drink to his lord.
The suspicion of his hideous purpose struck me
dumb with horror. The Shogun reached out and
lifted the bowl from the tray. At that my hands
spoke for my stricken tongue. I flung aside the
screen that was before me and threw out my arm
in a warning gesture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
Iyeyoshi paused with the bowl at his lips, and
stared at me in frowning resentment. I pointed
downward. The Shogun glanced from me to the
cringing figure of Gengo. Instantly he dashed
the bowl and its contents into the face of the
chamberlain.</p>

<p>No man of <i>samurai</i> blood might endure such
an insult even from the Sei-i-tai Shogun. The
poisoner flared out in mad fury. With amazing
swiftness he drew a dirk and bounded upon
Iyeyoshi. The Shogun flung himself to one side.
But Gengo struck with deadly aim. His dirk
plunged down through the base of the Shogun’s
neck the full twelve inches of the blade.</p>

<p>With a roar of fury, Satsuma leaped up to catch
the dying man and interpose his own body for
the second stroke. But Gengo was already springing
back, well aware that the one blow had done
the awful deed. We were already rushing in, my
companions shrieking for the guards. Midzuano
sat as if turned to stone. Gengo dropped down
almost beside the Counsellor, to make an end of
himself. The murderer was <i>samurai</i> bred. Swiftly
as I rushed forward, I could not seize him in time
to stay his dirk from the fatal cross stroke. He
sank prostrate on his face, groaning.</p>

<div id="ip_360" class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><img src="images/i_379.jpg" width="400" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Gengo Struck with Deadly Aim</span></div></div>

<p>From all sides <i>hatamotos</i> with bared swords
rushed in, drawn by the shrieks for help. As I
knelt with Satsuma beside our dead lord, Midzuano<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
leaped up and pointed to us, with a terrible cry:
“Strike! The Shogun is slain! Kill the traitors!”</p>

<p>An instant’s hesitancy and we should have been
hacked in pieces by the upraised swords. Satsuma
sprang to his feet, his great form swelling with
wrath, his heavy face dark with menace. Without
a word, he pointed one hand at the dying assassin
and the other at Midzuano.</p>

<p>“Strike!” commanded the Chief Counsellor,
and his dull eyes lighted with cold malevolence.</p>

<p>“Strike!” echoed Satsuma, still pointing.</p>

<p>The <i>hatamotos</i> glared at us in deadly rage, yet
stood motionless, checked by the power of the
great Daimio. I rose beside him, and signed to
the attendant with the <i>sake</i> flask. He pointed
to the dying chamberlain, and called loudly:
“Midzuano lies! Gengo is the traitor. He first
brought this flask to the Prince of Owari; then
came to serve the Shogun. His Highness had
cause to suspect poison. He flung the bowl into
the face of the traitor, who drew and struck.”</p>

<p>“The Counsellor is challenged to drink from the
flask brought to me by Gengo,” I added.</p>

<p>“They are all traitors.&mdash;Kill them together!”
cried Midzuano.</p>

<p>I held out Kohana’s scroll to the nearest <i>hatamoto</i>,
with a laconic command: “Read!”</p>

<p>The man took the blotched writing and began
to read, while all in the room bent to listen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
“‘Kwannon direct this safely into the hands of
a loyal <i>samurai</i>! Evil traitors plot to poison the
Shogun and the Prince of Owari, on the day that
the Prince goes to the palace. They cannot endure
that His Highness should favor a treaty with the
barbarians. Gengo is their tool. All the <i>daimios</i>
in the conspiracy are not known to the writer,
but the names of the leaders are, first&mdash;’”</p>

<p>With a sudden clutch, Midzuano plucked the
scroll out of the hand of the <i>hatamoto</i> and thrust
it into his bosom.</p>

<p>“The Chief of the Elder Council commands at
such a crisis,” he proclaimed with astounding
effrontery. “It is not expedient to publish the
names of the criminals until they have been apprehended.
Let the Council be summoned to meet
me at my <i>yashiki</i>.”</p>

<p>Even Satsuma was disconcerted by such consummate
assurance and audacity. Before either
of us could recover wit enough to utter a protest,
the Counsellor passed through the midst of the
<i>hatamotos</i> and out of the hall. But though he went
unopposed, his going was none the less in effect
a retreat. Freed from his malign influence, the
<i>hatamotos</i> at once yielded to the spell of Satsuma’s
magnetism and power. The great Daimio pointed
to the body of Gengo, which no longer writhed on
the mats.</p>

<p>“Tokugawa men,” he called in his deep and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
sonorous voice, “you have heard. There lies
the tool of the traitors who seek the overthrow
of the Shogunate. I charge the Chief Counsellor
with complicity. Minamoto Iyeyoshi has gone
from us without benefit of medicine. Let Minamoto
Iyesada the Shogun be notified of his
accession to the rulership. All men have faith in
the loyalty and wisdom of Abe Ise-no-kami and Ii
Kamon-no-kami. Send for them, that they may
advise His Highness.”</p>

<p>“The loyalty of Satsuma is undoubted,” called
one of the court officials. “He also should advise
Iyesada Sama.”</p>

<p>“That is for Abe and Ii. My task is to check
the plot of the traitors. Obey no orders from
Midzuano and the Council of Elders unless
approved by Iyesada Sama. Let all gates of the
citadel and the inner moat be doubly guarded.
Announce only that Iyeyoshi Sama has been
wounded by a traitor. I go to watch the <i>yashiki</i>
of the Chief Counsellor. Until I have received
the commands of the Shogun, no man shall enter
or leave the gate of Midzuano. There is need
for utmost haste!” He turned to fling out his
hand over the bloody corpse of Iyeyoshi&mdash;“Vengeance
upon the traitors!”</p>

<p>“Vengeance!” shouted the <i>hatamotos</i>, and they
rushed from the room in fierce eagerness to obey
the Daimio’s directions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
Satsuma signed for me to accompany him, and
as we hastened out, unattended, he gave me my
orders with courteous indirectness: “Ii is with us;
Abe at least neutral. Keiki and Midzuano are
the hands of old Mito. Without them he cannot
strike. I will seek to hold Midzuano.”</p>

<p>“Owari will hold Keiki if the Mito men do not
overwhelm us!” I responded.</p>

<p>“Old Mito will either strike at once, or draw
in his claws and wait for another opening.
Announce that Iyeyoshi has been wounded by a
Mito man. That will rally to us the greater
number of the three hundred thousand <i>samurais</i>
who have flocked to Yedo.”</p>

<p>“Wounded?&mdash;And slain?” I said.</p>

<p>“Only wounded. The city must be kept in
doubt until sanction of Iyesada’s accession has
been received from the Mikado. It will be well
for your august father to join his counsel to that
of Abe and Ii.&mdash;Here is your waiting-room.”</p>

<p>I nodded farewell, and darted into the banquet
room, where my retainers sat in decorous quiet,
keenly alert to the stir and commotion that
desecrated the solemn hush of the palace, yet all
unaware of its terrible cause. I told them that,
instigated by the Mito faction, my would-be
poisoner had wounded the Shogun, a deed worthy
of the days of the Ashikaga Shoguns.</p>

<p>Silencing their horrified outcries with a gesture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
I gave my seal to Yuki, and commanded him to
ride at full speed to Owari Yashiki and bring a force
to assist me in the blockade of Keiki’s residence.
He rushed out without an instant’s delay, while
I followed with the utmost haste that my princely
dignity would permit.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX&mdash;<span class="smcap">Intrigue</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Within</span> the hour Satsuma had
Midzuano trapped in his <i>yashiki</i>,
and I was closing in upon Keiki.
The Mito men gathered rapidly,
with the evident purpose of driving
us off or cutting their way through to their Hitotsubashi
allies. But the timely arrival of Yuki
with a thousand Owari retainers compelled the
enemy to draw back for reinforcements. Before
these could come up, the rumor of the attack upon
the Shogun had spread throughout the official
quarter, and so vast a number of loyal <i>samurais</i>
swarmed to my support that the Mito men barely
averted destruction by a quick retreat across the
outer moat to their Superior Yashiki.</p>

<p>A word from me would have precipitated an
attack that must have resulted in the certain
destruction of Keiki. But Yuki and my counsellors
alike advised me against a course of action that
would undoubtedly result in a conflagration not
alone of fire. The death of Keiki by the sword
would be the signal for civil war. Even the Prince
of Owari had no right to punish the Shogunate’s
enemies without the command of the Shogun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
The most I could do was to lay siege to the
fortified dwelling of the plotter, that no message
might pass between him and the old Prince, his
father. All through the day we waited, lined up
about the <i>yashiki</i>, and backed by the dense throngs
of <i>hatamotos</i> and loyal <i>samurais</i>, that came and
went, yet were always too numerous to be driven
back by a sortie of the Hitotsubashi men or
scattered before an attack by Mito. Keiki’s
retainers wisely kept close and made no display
of weapons at the <i>yashiki</i> windows. My men were
held by my command, but there were times when
an arrow or even a gibe would have stung our allies
to an instant storming of the traitor’s stronghold.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon my adopted father sent
a message commending my actions, and asking
me to hold my position until notified by Iyesada,
with whom he was advising. At nightfall we
lighted bamboo torches and vast numbers of
lanterns, that neither Keiki nor any messenger
might escape past us in the darkness.</p>

<p>A violent storm, accompanied by a deluge of
rain and a display of lightning most unusual in
Japan, swept over the city during the night, the
wind at one time blowing a full gale. But though
we were in the midst of the typhoon season, the
storm failed to augment to hurricane force. The
ardor of more than half of our volunteer allies was
quenched by the downpour and the turmoil of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
the elements. Appalled by the seeming anger
of the gods, they deserted us in great numbers.
Yet enough remained for the watch to be maintained
with utmost vigilance throughout storm
and night.</p>

<p>Dawn brought us a clearing sky and lulling
wind. At sunrise a rumor reached us that Midzuano
had committed <i>hara-kiri</i>. An hour later
an order from the palace, signed by Iyesada and
countersigned by Abe Ise-no-kami, commanded
me to withdraw my forces. Uncertain whether
to obey, I despatched a messenger to Satsuma for
instructions. Before the man could return, my
adopted father came to me in his <i>norimon</i> and
directed me to comply with Iyesada’s command.</p>

<p>Once again old Mito and his accomplices had
escaped the penalty of treason. Midzuano had
destroyed Kohana’s message, and with a false
fidelity in the very face of death, had left a testament
to the effect that he committed <i>hara-kiri</i>
in proof of his own innocence and the loyalty of
his friends. With consummate adroitness he had
converted what would have been taken as a confession
of guilt into a shield to hide his shame and
a mask for the crime of his fellow-conspirators.</p>

<p>Without proof positive, Abe Ise-no-kami, who
had already been appointed to the office of the
dead Counsellor, was of too cautious a temperament
to proceed to extremes. To assure himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
a majority, he had favored a reorganization of the
Council of Elders. Otherwise the regime of Iyesada
promised better opportunity for the success of Mito
than had the iron rule of Iyeyoshi. The father
had been a strong man, who could command the
fear and respect of all the great <i>daimios</i>; the son
was an amiable, capricious weakling. Abe, though
astute, was over-cautious and lacked the force and
magnetism of a leader. His would be a policy
of expediency.</p>

<p>Such were the bitter comments of my father as
we sat in Owari Yashiki, breaking our fast on the
dainty dishes served us by my quaint little mother.
Divining with subtle intuition the great fear that
troubled her son, Tokiwa Sama ventured to inquire
what effect the murder of Iyeyoshi would have on
my marriage. The Prince confessed his inability
to foresee, but assured me that he would make
every effort to obtain from Abe and Iyesada a
confirmation of the agreement.</p>

<p>With this he left us and returned to the palace,&mdash;to
find Keiki already in conference with the new
Chief Counsellor. It was the beginning of a
ceaseless contest of influence and intrigue between
Owari and Mito.</p>

<p>Sobered by the fate of his fellow-conspirator
and guided no doubt by the crafty counsel of his
imprisoned father, Keiki restrained his fiery temper
and proved himself a master of subtlety. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
every move he expressed a heartfelt desire for an
amicable adjustment of differences and for the
coalescence of all parties under the banner of the
Shogunate. This was his protestation even while
his agents were intriguing with the Kyoto court
nobles to prevent the formal investiture of Iyesada
with the title and office of Sei-i-tai Shogun.</p>

<p>Meantime he had the audacity to demand the
immediate release of his father, my degradation
and deportation as a <i>tojin</i>, and the marriage of
Azai to himself. Our only positive proposition
was that the ports should be opened for temporary
intercourse. Against us the Mito faction stirred
up all the prejudices, fears, and passions of the
proud <i>samurai</i> class.</p>

<p>Abe assumed a judicial attitude, and did all
that lay in his power to conciliate the contending
factions. To please Mito, he authorized the
building of war junks, the drilling of an army, and
the casting of cannon. Plans for forts upon the
shoals opposite Shinagawa were rushed to completion
and work begun.</p>

<p>To please Owari, he refused to take action
against me, caused the abrogation of the law that
required persons suspected of Christianity to tread
upon the cross, held the question of releasing old
Mito in abeyance, and intimated that with regard
to Azai he rather favored me above Keiki, but
would make no decision until the regular investiture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
of Iyesada gave the new Shogun the prestige of the
Mikadoic sanction.</p>

<p>The last of the answers of the <i>daimios</i> to the
letters of inquiry sent out by Iyeyoshi were now
coming in, and Abe compared them with the others,
with a politic inclination towards the weightier
scale. Yet decision was difficult. The vast
majority of the counsellors were uncertain and
confused in their advice. Against a seeming
weight of opinion in favor of the ancient laws,
the perplexed premier had to consider the demands
of the Russian admiral, Pontiatine, just received
from Nagasaki, the not improbable event of a
visit from the powerful Asiatic fleet of the British,
and the future but certain return of Commodore
Perry.</p>

<p>The inevitable result was a continuance of the
policy of compromise. The Mito intrigues at
Kyoto were delaying the investiture of Iyesada.
To secure the Mikadoic sanction the weak Chief
Counsellor promised Keiki the release of his father.
To appease our party for this concession to the
enemy, Abe pledged his personal influence in favor
of a temporary treaty and engaged to secure the
assent of the Mikado. Keiki obtained an additional
concession that old Rekko should be placed
in command of the defences of Yedo.</p>

<p>When the Prince heard of this last victory of
Mito, he went to the palace in a rage. Abe was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
most apologetic, but insisted that the concession
had been pledged under the seal of Iyesada, and
could not be withdrawn. As a peace offering he
agreed to obtain Iyesada’s assent to my marriage
with Azai.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX&mdash;<span class="smcap">My Wedding Eve</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">When</span> the Prince returned with this
last news, I found that at heart
I was still very much a <i>tojin</i>. All
thought of state affairs, the interests
of my new country and of my old country,
were alike forgotten in the selfish joy of my love.
I was to wed my little Princess!</p>

<p>Blissful elation gave way to doubt and anxiety.
The death of Iyeyoshi had not yet been announced.
Abe was waiting for the Mikado’s envoys. When
Iyesada had been duly confirmed in his rule,
Iyeyoshi would be officially declared dead and
would be buried with all due pomp amongst his
forefathers either at Shiba or Uyeno. My fear
was that, once the period of mourning had begun,
Azai might not be permitted to marry me until
the termination of the prescribed months of
sorrow.</p>

<p>Though puzzled by my feverish impatience at
the bare possibility of delay, the Prince urged
the matter upon Satsuma. The Daimio, no less
willing to please me than to disappoint Keiki,
enlisted the assistance of his adopted daughter,
Iyesada’s wife. The lady was, I suspect, delighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
with the opportunity to remove from the palace
one whose influence was far greater than her
own.</p>

<p>Abe found Iyesada not only willing but urgent
to bind the House of Owari to his interests by
means of the marriage. Satsuma offered himself
as intermediator between the two families.
Arrangements were made under a mutual agreement
that, in view of the circumstances, the
wedding should be conducted without display.
An act accomplished escapes opposition and a
large share of the criticism otherwise uttered in
the hope of prevention.</p>

<p>The wishes of Azai were not consulted. She
was told that she would be wedded to me the
following night. Presents were exchanged, and
the trousseau of my bride was brought at once
to Owari Yashiki, in the charge of Azai’s ladies-in-waiting.
Even Tokiwa Sama was impressed by
the display of silk costumes and ornaments and
artistic articles of personal and household use
arranged in the bridal apartments by the ladies
of the Princess. My own wardrobe was arranged
by my mother and her maids.</p>

<p>Propriety required that I should not view the
trousseau of my bride before the ceremony. But
chance gave me one glimpse that stirred my heart
to deepest tenderness. While passing one of
the inner garden courts, I chanced to gaze across,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
and caught sight of a girl within the opposite
veranda. It was O Setsu San bearing in the
favorite dolls of her mistress.</p>

<p>I sought the seclusion of a grape arbor in the
largest of the <i>yashiki</i> gardens, and mused for hours
upon the sweet innocence of my little Princess
bride. The thought of her childlike purity filled
me with adoration. I had won the love and trust
of this young maiden who yet played with her
dolls. I must be very gentle with her.</p>

<p>Death had deprived her of a father’s fond care,
marriage was to cut her off from home and mother.
By entering the family of Owari she was to become
as one dead to her own family. She had been the
petted daughter of an indulgent father; she was
to become the wife and servant of a husband and
the humble subordinate of a mother-in-law, whose
commands must be obeyed.</p>

<p>Yet hers was a fate far better than the fate of
most Japanese brides. She loved me and knew
that she was loved: others went to husbands
unknown to them, many without so much as the
preliminary meeting common among the lower
classes. Tokiwa Sama I knew would be a mild
tyrant to the gentle daughter-in-law. As a concession
to my <i>tojin</i> prejudices, if not because of
the winsomeness of my bride, she would not deal
harshly with my wife.</p>

<p>This I knew because she had already made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
amazing concession of supporting me in a contest
against custom. It was my earnest desire
that my bride should come to the wedding without
the customary shaving of eyebrows and blackening
of teeth. I had laid great stress upon this
strange proposal. The matter had been carried
up to Iyesada, and precedent found for a postponement
of the senseless blemishings until after the
marriage.</p>

<p>Though much astonishment was expressed over
the betrayal of such absurd prejudices by the
Prince of Owari, Satsuma won over his daughter,
and Iyesada bent to the wish of his Shoguness.
The Princess Azai was ordered to comply with the
whim of her future husband. For the time, at
least, I had saved the beauty of my darling.</p>

<p>The good news of this concession was brought
to me by Satsuma on the morning of my wedding
day, and it added no little to my rapturous anticipations.
Overcome with joy, I went out into
the gardens and wandered about, neglectful of
my duties, lost in a maze of blissful visions. But
presently the old Prince sought me out and sobered
me with his paternal reproof.</p>

<p>“Is it so that Woroto prepares himself for matrimony?”
he asked. “On the day of all days when
a man should think reverently of the family, my
son has neglected to stand before the shrines of
his forefathers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
I kowtowed to the ground. “The rebuke of
my august parent is just. I will go at once.”</p>

<p>He restrained me with a gesture as I rose to
hasten in. “Stay, my son. It is well for you
to realize that what you have set your heart upon
with such strange ardor is not certain of attainment
even now.”</p>

<p>“Not certain!” I cried. “You bring ill news
from the palace?”</p>

<p>“I have not been to the palace. From all I
know, your day’s fortunes are as bright as is this
sky after the rain.”</p>

<p>“Yet you say&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Have you then failed to grasp the characteristics
of your new people, Woroto? Do you forget
that the times when we should most expect our
enemy to strike are the hours of our greatest
joys and triumphs? Your audience as Prince of
Owari brought you the flask of poisoned <i>sake</i>.”</p>

<p>“<i>Namida!</i>” I murmured, seized with vague
dread. “You have heard of another plot! Keiki
plans to rob me of my bride! Yuki has brought
word again from Kohana!”</p>

<p>“Nothing has been heard of any plot. Yuki
brings no word from the <i>geisha</i>. He committed the
grave error of leaving in the street the hollow arrow
in which she shot out to him the message of the
poison plot. If it was picked up by the Mito men,
we have the explanation why no more arrows have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
dropped beside the <i>ronin</i>. The girl will render no
further service to Owari.”</p>

<p>“But the Shogun’s daughter&mdash;my bride?” I
exclaimed, selfishly heedless of whatever fate the
<i>geisha</i> may have suffered. “You think it possible
that Keiki will again attack her cortege?”</p>

<p>“Look for all evil from your foe when fortune
seems fairest. Go now. The gods await your
prayers.”</p>

<p>I bowed, and with unfeigned gravity went in
to set the daily offerings before the Buddhist
family shrine and murmur the daily invocation
before the Shinto tablets: “Ye forefathers of the
generations, and of our families, and of our kindred,&mdash;unto
you, the founders of our homes, we utter
the gladness of our thanks.”</p>

<p>My duty as acting head of the household was
fulfilled, but my disquiet continued. I returned
to the garden and roved about for hours, unable
to overcome the dread of impending disaster.
As evening approached, my alarm increased,
though I knew that Fujimaro and Yuki had been
sent with a powerful escort to accompany the
bride. When I was required to go in to prepare
for the ceremony, Tokiwa Sama sought to smile
away my dread. But I was in a fever of apprehension
until announcement was made that the
bridal cortege was entering the great gate of
the <i>yashiki</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
At this my dread gave way to joy no less unreasoning.
I hastened in my ceremonial costume
to the position within the entrance where I was
to receive my bride. Outside, to right and left,
two fires had been lighted, and beside each an
aged couple stood waiting with a rice mortar.
Near me was stationed one of the ladies-in-waiting
with a lantern, and other ladies stood behind her.</p>

<p>The armed escort had halted in the courtyard,
and the bridal party was already entering the
inner enclosure. In the light of the gay lanterns
I saw the <i>norimon</i> of the Princess, which had been
turned about end for end to symbolize her death
to her family. It was borne forward in the midst
of the high officials of the palace household. My
chief retainers gathered before the entrance to meet
and exchange congratulations with the <i>hatamotos</i>.
The old couples beside the fires began to pound rice
in their mortars and to call out felicitations: “A
thousand years!&mdash;Ten thousand years!”</p>

<p>The <i>norimon</i>, which had been placed upon the
mats, was again raised and borne in before me.
The lady-in-waiting held her lantern for me.
I parted the curtain and looked in upon the lovely
face of my bride. Her pure young eyes met
mine, aglow with the soft radiance of perfect
love and trust. For either to have spoken would
have been most improper. But we gazed deep
into one another’s eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
The lady-in-waiting uttered a faint murmur.
Azai blushed scarlet and raised one of her sleeves
before her face. With her free hand she held
out to me the bag of brocaded silk that contained
her amulet or talisman. As I took it from her,
the <i>norimon</i> was carried in past me, led by the
lady with the lantern. I handed the amulet bag
to another lady-in-waiting, and withdrew to my
private rooms.</p>

<p>Even to my impatience the interval did not
seem unduly prolonged before I was requested to
enter the ceremonial chamber. My attendants
stopped in the anteroom. I entered alone.</p>

<p>Azai sat in the place of honor, before the
<i>tokonoma</i>, dressed in robes of pure white silk, which
had been sent to her in my name. Over her head
was draped a veil of white crepe. To all others
the costume was symbolic of death and mourning,
to myself it was the emblem of bridal purity.</p>

<p>According to immemorial custom, no relatives
were present. Satsuma, as our mediator, took
the place of priest and magistrate, although he
now had nothing to say and nothing else to do
than to sit with his wife. Aside from this friendly
couple, O Setsu San and others of the ladies-in-waiting
attended upon their mistress.</p>

<p>Food and <i>sake</i> had been laid out in the <i>tokonoma</i>,
which was decorated with branches of pine and
bamboo and cherry. When I had taken my seat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
below and to one side of Azai, two of the ladies
served us with chestnuts, edible seaweed, and
dried fish, bowing and murmuring gracious words
of compliment.</p>

<p>The <i>sake</i> was in two wine flasks to which had
been attached a pair of butterflies, symbolic of
our souls. These flasks and two heating kettles
were taken from the <i>tokonoma</i> to the lower part
of the room, and the amber wine poured ceremoniously
into one and then the other kettle.</p>

<p>Three cups, placed one within the other on a
tray, were brought to me with the <i>sake</i>. I drank
twice from the upper cup, poured a little <i>sake</i>
from the full kettle into the empty one, and drank
again from the same cup. The service was now
carried before Azai, who drank and poured as I
had done. The wine was returned to the <i>tokonoma</i>
and food served to us.</p>

<p>Again the <i>sake</i> was brought out, and we drank as
before, except that Azai was served first and used
the second cup. For the second time the <i>sake</i>
was returned to the <i>tokonoma</i> and food served.
Last of all, the <i>sake</i> was brought to us once more
and I led, as at first, by drinking from the third
cup.</p>

<p>Throughout this mute yet solemn ceremony
I was compelled to sit with face half averted from
my sweet bride. To look at her would have been
rude and unmannerly. I had to content myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
with stolen side-glances at her dainty head under
its soft white veil. She held her eyes modestly
downcast.</p>

<p>I now rose and withdrew to one room, and
Azai retired to another, while our attendants
were served with refreshments. I returned to
take the seat of honor. Immediately my little
bride entered, no longer attired in white, but in
a kimono of soft dark silk. The veil had been
removed, and I saw that her hair was dressed
after the fashion of married women. She was now
my wife.</p>

<p>As she nestled down in the place which had been
mine, my parents and the wedding guests entered
to congratulate us and to join in the feast that
was served. For the time being austerity was
laid aside, and joy reigned supreme. Owari was
providing for the perpetuation of the family. It
was proper for all relatives and friends to feast
and rejoice. Course followed course, and wit and
poetry flowed as freely as the amber rice-wine.</p>

<p>At last, close upon midnight, the feast drew
to a close, and the guests prepared to leave. I sat
with my bride, receiving the final congratulations
and farewells. The more wearied of the guests
hurried off; the others prepared to follow. Soon
the last would withdraw, and we should be left
alone with Satsuma and his wife, who were to
conduct us to the bridal chamber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
Suddenly I heard Yuki’s voice in the anteroom,
raised in loud protest. The Prince hastened out
through the midst of the departing guests, enraged
at the unseemly disturbance. All followed his
going with startled looks. In the hush that fell
upon us I heard voices murmuring punctilious
salutations.</p>

<p>The Prince reappeared, his face no longer flushed,
but hard and cold. He waved his fan towards
Azai, and commanded in a harsh voice: “Lead
her out.”</p>

<p>But my darling had sensed the danger with
quick intuition. She threw herself before me and
grasped at the edge of my robe. Over her bowed
head I caught sight of a grotesque, glittering figure
on the threshold. It was Keiki, in full armor.</p>

<p>My first thought was that the occasion had
enabled the Mito men to enter the <i>yashiki</i> by
stealth and overwhelm our retainers in their
quarters. Yet an attack, however sudden and
stealthy, must have meant some uproar of yells
and clashing blades. We could not have failed
to hear the struggle, even had there been no
other sounds than the shrieks of the women.</p>

<p>As I rose, I perceived that the sword of our
unwelcome visitor was sheathed and in the hands
of a bearer. There was no danger of immediate
violence. Yuki stood close at the shoulder of
my enemy. Nevertheless there was a grim menace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
in the glinting armor and hideous face-mask of the
son of Mito.</p>

<p>I bowed in response to his mocking salute, and
attempted an ironical greeting: “Keiki Sama
comes late to my wedding feast. Yet food remains.
Let him be seated.”</p>

<p>“I come late and go soon,” he replied, in a tone
that seemed to bring a sneer to the brazen lips
of his mask’s gaping maw. “I come late, but
still in time. Does the hairy barbarian grieve
that I did not come sooner?”</p>

<p>I turned inquiringly to the Prince. Before
the enemy he could betray no weakness. His
voice sounded harsh and constrained: “Keiki
Sama bears the edict of the Mikado, which holds
that Woroto is legally neither my son nor Prince
of Owari. He whom I have regarded as my son is
declared to be a criminal and a man of alien race.
Keiki Sama bears the warrant of Minamoto
Iyesada and the Council of Elders to arrest
Adamisu Woroto and hold him in close confinement.”</p>

<p>Satsuma stepped forward. “Keiki Sama is
requested to delay the execution of his orders
until dawn. The pledge of Satsuma is offered.”</p>

<p>“The pledge of Satsuma may not be scorned
by any <i>daimio</i> or son of a <i>daimio</i>. Nevertheless
the occasion does not permit of delay. The
command of the Shogun is imperative,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
Keiki, and he displayed his warrant with the
great vermilion seal of Minamoto Iyesada.</p>

<p>“My Lord Woroto,” called Yuki, “your enemy
has duped the Shogun with evil lies. Are there
no <i>samurais</i> in Owari Yashiki?”</p>

<p>“The barbarian is welcome to call upon Owari
to rebel against the will of the Shogun,” mocked
Keiki. “The august Rekko, Prince of Mito, now
commands the forces of the Shogunate. Ten
thousand warriors surround Owari Yashiki.”</p>

<p>I stooped before them all, and pressed my lips
upon the bloodless lips of Azai. “Farewell, my
wife! We will meet on that other side!”</p>

<p>“You go, my lord!” she gasped.</p>

<p>“Better that the <i>tojin</i> outcast should suffer
than all Owari,” I replied, and I loosened her
clutching little fingers. No one should share my
fate.</p>

<p>She tottered up to follow me down the room.
But Nature was more merciful than Keiki. She
swooned into the arms of my weeping mother.
The Prince averted his head, unable to mask
his emotion. I advanced swiftly past the guests
that had lingered, and held out my sheathed dirk
to Keiki.</p>

<p>“Lead out, badger! The <i>tojin</i> is ready,” I
said.</p>

<p>“Go before, demon!” he commanded, enraged
at the shameful name I gave him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
Yuki had disappeared, but the Prince stepped
to my side.</p>

<p>“Owari dono will escort to the portico him who
was his son,” he said.</p>

<p>We walked out side by side, followed by Keiki
and his swordbearer. We went in silence. The
Prince could offer me no hope, and it was no time
to give way to grief. In the portico we exchanged
formal bows of farewell. I passed on out.</p>

<p>Yuki approached, with his hands in his sleeves,
and sought to edge up beside me. I divined that
he schemed to slip me one or both of my revolvers.
But Keiki was keen-eyed and vigilant. He thrust
himself between us. With the swordbearer on
the other side, I walked out through the state
gate of Owari Yashiki, into the midst of the mail-clad
<i>samurais</i> of Mito and Hitotsubashi.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI&mdash;<span class="smcap">In the Power of Mito</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">At</span> the command of Keiki, men with
iron gloves seized me and stripped me
of my brocaded wedding robes. Bound
hand and foot, I was flung into a
<i>kago</i> and a net entwined about me.
I was spared the shame of daylight, but torches
and lanterns exposed the white-skinned captive to
all who chose to look and revile.</p>

<p>They bore me along the outer moat to Mito
Yashiki and through the great gate into the grim
torture chamber. Without loosening the rattan
withes that cut my flesh, they dropped me into
a dungeon pit built beneath the stone floor of
the chamber. I was flung in headlong, but
managed to turn in the air and alight upon my
feet. Otherwise I believe the fall would have
proved fatal. Had I been stunned, I must have
smothered in the ankle-deep slime that covered
the bottom of the pit.</p>

<p>Even as it was, I could not hold my balance
with my bound feet, squarely as I struck. I
sprawled prone in the filth. As I struggled up to
a sitting position, Keiki flung down a torch at
me. The flaming end tore and seared the skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
of my naked side and glanced down into the slime
with a loud splutter.</p>

<p>“Hear the snarl of the <i>tojin</i> beast!” he jeered.
“We have been told much of frogs in the well.
Mito can now tell of the toad in the pit.”</p>

<p>With this a great stone was clapped over the
mouth of the dungeon, and I was left to the
misery of my fetid quarters and the anguish of
my thoughts. The moistening of my bonds in
the slime eased somewhat the pain of their
incutting edges. But nothing could ease my
mental agony.</p>

<p>Since the first I had been as it were dazed by
the disaster that had befallen me. Now I no
longer had the presence of my enemy to sustain
the anger that had added to my bewilderment.
Cold horror dampened my fury even as the dank
air of the dungeon chilled my fevered body. As
my brain cooled I began to realize with frightful
clearness the full measure of my downfall. One
hour, Prince of Owari, in all Yedo second to none
other than the Shogun,&mdash;the next, a despised
barbarian toad in this pit of filth. One hour, the
bridegroom of the Shogun’s daughter,&mdash;the next,
an outcast menaced with atrocious torture and
infamous execution.</p>

<p>In vain I sought to gain a shred of hope by wild
thoughts of rescue. Always I came back to the
bitter realization that Mito had outwitted Owari.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
Backed by the Mikadoic decree, Mito was all
but unassailable. Armed with the authority of
the Shogunate, old Rekko and his faction held
the sword above Owari, eager for a sign of rebellion.
My father had forewarned me that he
could do nothing if the Shogun commanded my
punishment. I thought of Satsuma and the power
of his personality with a momentary glimmer.
If Mito failed to bar his way to the palace, the
great Daimio could reach Iyesada through his
daughter. Iyesada would command Abe, and
<span class="locked">then&mdash;</span></p>

<p>But Abe had called upon the tiger for aid, and
had been lured on until he had put his head into
the tiger’s mouth. He would have enough to do
to extricate himself and his master, without
troubling over the difficulties of a <i>tojin</i> toad in
Keiki’s pit. All was lost to me, all!&mdash;my new
country and friends, rank and title, father and
mother, and&mdash;Azai!</p>

<p>I had to thank the mephitic gases of the dungeon
for a merciful dulling of consciousness. With the
single opening at the top covered over, the air
became so close and foul that I sank into a stupor.
I cowered lower in the slime, with my chin fallen
forward on my breast. My anguish resolved
itself into hideous unending nightmares.</p>

<p>A sharp pang in the front of my left breast
roused me from my torpor. About me I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
the loathsome walls of the dungeon illumined by
a ray of reflected sunlight. The darting pain in
my breast redoubled in sharpness. I was jerked
upright. A pole had been lowered through the
hole above me, and the hook upon its end had been
slipped under my left arm. When drawn up,
the point of the hook had pierced the muscles
of my chest. Strong hands hoisted me roughly
upwards to the mouth of the pit. I was swung
out and cast down upon the stone flagging of the
torture chamber. The shock won a groan from
me where even the hook had failed.</p>

<p>“The toad croaks!” jeered a voice I should have
known had I been dying. Numbed by my bonds
I could scarcely twist my head about to glare my
hate into his beautiful evil face. He smiled and
bowed low to me. “Behold the bridegroom, fresh
come from his bridal chamber! Ten thousand
felicitous years!”</p>

<p>“My lord will not permit the beast to stand
unwashed before the presence of the august
Rekko Sama,” remarked one of the chamberlains
who stood beside Keiki. “The august Prince
abhors stenches.”</p>

<p>“Let hot water be brought,” commanded Keiki.
“It were a shame to defile even an <i>eta’s</i> bath
with the filth of a <i>tojin</i> toad.”</p>

<p>At the word, attendants clattered out to fetch
buckets of steaming water. The first bucketful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
was so near scalding that I writhed under it like
an eel in the pan. Others, no less hot, followed
in quick succession, while men with brooms
scoured my parboiled skin and beat me between
the drenchings. I thought I should die of the
torture.</p>

<p>Yet the water was not quite hot enough to
scald me, and between it and the scouring brooms,
I was cleansed of the dungeon filth. No surgeon
could have bathed my wounds more thoroughly.
My violent gasps pumped the pure air deep into
my poisoned lungs, and the heavy throbs of my
heart sent the blood tingling through my benumbed
limbs and brain. When Keiki gave command to
cease the washing, I lay outstretched on the wet
stones, bruised and aching from head to foot, but
freed from all the ill effects of the pit.</p>

<p>“My august father will now view the snow
white skin of the <i>tojin sama</i>,” said Keiki. “Cut
loose the ankle withe.”</p>

<p>The rattan about my ankles was slashed apart,
and I was jerked to my feet. Though weak and
unsteady, I was able to stand unaided. Prodding
dirks drove me across to the front of the torture
chamber, where a frame with curtains of split
bamboo had been set up on the matting of the
raised floor. Keiki stepped up and kowtowed
beside the frame. I heard no sound, but presently
he turned and addressed me with mock courtesy:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
“The <i>tojin sama</i> is requested to exhibit to august
eyes the manners of his people.”</p>

<p>I stared at the centre of the curtain, through
which I fancied that I saw the outline of a seated
figure.</p>

<p>“The Prince of Mito is said to regard <i>tojins</i> as
midway between beasts and demons,” I replied.
“He will have ample opportunity to judge of
<i>tojin</i> manners when the black ships of my people
return to Yedo Bay.”</p>

<p>“Woroto Sama will not be so unkind as to
compel the august one to wait an uncertain event,”
purred Keiki. “Request is made that he show
the behavior of a <i>tojin</i> of low birth who has been
overcome with drink.”</p>

<p>“It is evident that Rekko Sama seeks to ape
the tricks of the shoguns with the Dutchmen,”
I rejoined. “There is this difference&mdash;Rekko
Sama is not yet Shogun, and I am not a Dutch
tradesman.”</p>

<p>Keiki’s smile deepened, and he murmured
imploringly: “Yet will not the American lord
condescend to exhibit the manner in which a
<i>daimio</i> of his people salutes his bride?”</p>

<p>Had my hands been free I must have leaped
upon the raised floor and throttled him or been
killed in the attempt. I bowed over and waited
until I had regained my self-control. My reply
was uttered as suavely as his jeer: “In my land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
there is an inferior people, smooth-faced and <i>not</i>
white-skinned. They are a race of base savages,
who, until conquered and subjected by my people,
delighted in the torment of their captives.”</p>

<p>Across Keiki’s face flitted a look that might
have done credit to an Iroquois or Sioux warrior
dancing before the stake of a burning enemy.
He was defeated on his own ground. There
was a short pause. I fancied that I heard a
murmur. Keiki signed with his fan, and waved
me aside.</p>

<p>Behind where I had been standing was a post
similar to the one in the torture chamber of the
High Court. A screen slipped open, and two
<i>etas</i> appeared with a woman between them. As
they crossed to the post the woman raised her
head. It was Kohana San. She smiled and
bowed to me as if I had been seated before her in
the state audience hall of Owari Yashiki. She
would have kowtowed had the pariahs loosened
their brutal grip of her rounded arms. Keiki
looked at her with a devilish smile.</p>

<p>“The complicity of the <i>geisha</i> in the crimes of
the barbarian is established,” he said. “She may
yet win the mercy of a swift death by confessing
her knowledge of the barbarian’s intent to betray
Nippon to his countrymen.”</p>

<p>“Keiki Sama already has the answer of the
<i>geisha</i>,” replied Kohana in her clear bell-like voice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
“Woroto Sama came to serve Dai Nippon, not
to betray.”</p>

<p>“Kohana forgets. We will aid her memory,”
mocked Keiki.</p>

<p>The <i>eta</i> torturers dragged the girl to the post
and lashed her fast. A silk cord was looped around
her head and twisted tight with a stick.</p>

<p>“Speak!” commanded Keiki.</p>

<p>“The truth has been told,” she replied.</p>

<p>The torturer with the stick began to twist.
At the first shriek I bounded forward to fling
myself upon the <i>etas</i>. Guards rushed between
and bore me back. The shrieks died away in a
moan. Kohana had swooned. The cord was
relaxed, and a pungent powder held to the girl’s
nostrils. She revived.</p>

<p>“Speak!” commanded Keiki.</p>

<p>“The truth has been told,” she gasped.</p>

<p>Keiki made a sign, and the torturer again twisted
the cord. As it tightened, the agony became
greater than the girl could bear.</p>

<p>“Wait!&mdash;Have mercy!” she screamed.</p>

<p>“Loose the cord,” commanded Keiki, and he
cast an exultant look at me. “We shall now
learn the truth.”</p>

<p>For a few moments the tortured girl’s bosom rose
and fell in gasping sobs. At last she summoned
strength enough to lift her head and speak. But
it was not Keiki whom she addressed. Her voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
rang out in the ecstasy of self-sacrifice: “My
Lord Yoritomo! can it be they think I will lie to
harm thy friend?&mdash;To thee, my august lord,
the last word of thy humble servant!”</p>

<p>She paused. Blood gushed from between her
lips. Her head sank forward. One of the <i>etas</i>
wrenched open her mouth, and cried out that she
had bitten off her tongue. Love had triumphed
over hate. The most frightful torture could not
now compel the <i>geisha</i> to denounce the friend of
her dead lord.</p>

<p>For a moment I thought that Keiki would
hurl himself upon the heroic girl. A low murmur
came from behind the bamboo curtains. Keiki
signed to the <i>etas</i>. “Return the traitress to the
cage until the time appointed for her crucifixion.”</p>

<p>“Demon!” I cried. “Beast! <i>Aino!</i>”</p>

<p>A guard struck me a violent blow across the
mouth.</p>

<p>“Fling the toad back into his slime hole!”
commanded Keiki.</p>

<p>“The nobles of Nippon are civilized!” I gibed
at him between my bleeding lips.</p>

<p>The shot struck, though not where I had aimed.</p>

<p>“Stay!” commanded a stern voice from behind
the curtains. “The barbarian beast shall have
no justification for his revilement of Mito. Let
the sentence and warrant be shown him, and let
him be caged as a condemned <i>daimio</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
I had touched the vanity of the hidden Prince
of Mito. Keiki bent to mutter a protest. For
answer, two documents were thrust out between
the slits of the bamboo curtain. Keiki mustered
his courtier’s smile, and turned to open the documents
before me, that I might see their vermilion
seals.</p>

<p>“‘The sentence of the High Court, condemning
to death Woroto the <i>tojin</i> for discharging a firearm
in Yedo&mdash;’” he began.</p>

<p>“The Prince of Mito knows that this unjust
sentence was annulled by the express command
of Minamoto Iyeyoshi,” I interrupted.</p>

<p>“The Prince of Mito has received the sentence
of the High Court and the warrant of the Council
of Elders,” replied Keiki suavely. “No order of
annulment had been received from Minamoto
Iyeyoshi.”</p>

<p>To this I had no answer. There could be no
doubt of the duplicity of my enemies. The
entire proceeding was illegal. But I was absolutely
in their power. To have cried out in protest
would have served only to gratify their malice.
Finding that I remained silent, Keiki made a
sign. I was led past the gaping mouth of the pit,
and out through a low opening, into a room lined
with wooden cages.</p>

<p>A <i>samurai</i> covered my wounds with plasters
of dampened paper; a tattered silk kimono was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
wrapped about me, and I was thrust into one of the
cages. After a time food and tea were brought
and set in between the massive bars. To my
astonishment, I discovered that I was ravenously
hungry. I devoured the food, and stretched out
upon the rough planks of my prison cell, overcome
with plethora and exhaustion. A heavy sleep
came to ease my aching body and racked brain.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII&mdash;<span class="smcap">Led out to Execution</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap1">For</span> two days I was kept caged, but fed and
waited upon by <i>eta</i> gaolers with utmost
deference. Why there should have been
such a delay I could not conjecture,
unless time was required to check some
move of my friends, or unless Mito wished Kohana
and myself to regain our strength, so that we might
suffer the more keenly during our execution.
Utmost precautions were taken that I should
find no means to put an end to myself.</p>

<p>On the third day I was roused before dawn and
led to a bathroom. My wounds were now almost
healed, and my full strength had come back to
me. But when I stepped from the cage, my arms
were gripped by two <i>samurais</i> in such a manner
that a slight twist would have dislocated the
shoulder joints. Of this I was given a hint, as
a warning against any attempt to escape. Otherwise
I was treated with deference. After the bath
I was clad in a worn but clean robe of silk, and
led back to my cage for breakfast.</p>

<p>When I had eaten, I was again asked to leave
the cage. As I stepped through the opening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
<i>etas</i> seized me and lashed my arms behind my
back. I was led out to a court crowded with
warriors in full armor, and forced into a <i>kago</i>,
over which nets were wound. Dawn had not
yet come, but torches flung a weird and lurid
light over the outlandish figures of the armored
<i>samurais</i>.</p>

<p>Another <i>kago</i> was borne forward past mine.
Within the nets that enmeshed it I saw the bowed
form of a woman. She raised her head, and I
perceived the pallid face of Kohana. She greeted
me with a smile that wrenched my heart.</p>

<p>“Buddha bless you!” I called. “Be strong.
There is one who awaits us beyond!”</p>

<p>Her dark eyes glistened with tears of gratitude
at the words of sympathy. But the bearers of
her <i>kago</i> hastened past. She disappeared among
the close ranks of the <i>samurais</i>. A signal was
given, and the torch bearers filed out of the court.
The <i>samurais</i> strutted after, with clanking armor.
Others appeared and fell in behind my <i>kago</i>.
I was borne out in the midst of the procession.</p>

<p>Outside the gateway of the <i>yashiki</i>, Keiki,
mounted on an armored stallion, waited at the
head of several thousand warriors. The lowly
<i>geisha</i> and the despised <i>tojin</i> were to be escorted
through Yedo by an army of <i>samurais</i>&mdash;though
not in honor.</p>

<p>Dawn was at hand as we started along the causeway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
of the outer moat towards Owari Yashiki.
Far away, over the western suburbs of the city,
I caught the glorious vision of Fuji-yama, glowing
high in the blue-black sky, like a symbol of hope
in the night of my despair. My spirits revived
with unreasoning elation. But Keiki led his
warriors on along the causeway, and within the
half-hour the exultant Mito men were marching
past Owari Yashiki in the full light of dawn,
with an insolent clamor of conches and wooden
clappers. The ranks about me opened out, that
I might be seen.</p>

<p>No sound came from the <i>yashiki</i>; no face peered
from the grated windows. We clashed past the
great gateway. It was closed tight. The Mito
men strutted past, shouting in derision. No
band rushed out in fierce sortie, as I had expected.
No face appeared at the windows. I was
abandoned to my fate. My head sank forward
upon my breast.</p>

<p>Before me rose a picture of the beautiful gardens
and fairylike palace; of my quaint and gentle
little mother Tokiwa, my stately father. But all
vanished before the white face of Azai. A pang
of doubt and despair pierced my brain. Was
Azai still here in the <i>yashiki</i>, vainly longing for
me?&mdash;had she gone before me, with her dirk
through that white throat?&mdash;or had she been taken
away to be given to Keiki? I muttered a curse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
upon my friends. I was being borne past the end
of Owari Yashiki, and not even Yuki my swordbearer
had struck a blow for me....</p>

<p>Down through west and south Yedo was a
long and tedious march. But I failed to heed the
passage of time. I had sunk into a lethargy of
despair. Only once I roused up. They were
bearing me past the groves of Shiba, now glorious
with the tints of autumn. The northeast monsoon,
after weeks of steady effort, had blown the
moisture of the Japan Current southward. The
air was as clear as crystal, the blue sky cloudless.
It was no day to lead a man out to a hideous
death&mdash;I should have been strolling through the
gardens with Azai....</p>

<p>On to the Tokaido, and down along the bay
shore through Shinagawa, marched the grimly
grotesque warriors of antique Nippon. It seemed
a lifetime since my dear brother had led me after
the cortege of Satsuma, through the black gate
and along the broad way and down that narrow
street to the house of Kohana. Now the <i>geisha</i>
was going with me to meet him&mdash;through the
black gate of death!</p>

<p>At the southern boundary of Shinagawa the main
force of our escort halted. We were borne onward,
guarded only by a hundred swordsmen and an
equal number of pikemen. We came to the
pillory upon which I had seen the five heads.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
My bearers swung past. This was not the place
where we were to suffer.</p>

<p>Out on the blue bay I saw great foundations
of stone rising from the shoals that barred the
approach to Yedo. Toiling workers swarmed over
and about the half-constructed forts, to which
strings of sampans were lightering blocks of stone
from junks that lay in the offing. Other craft
sailed up or down the bay, or lay at anchor in the
deeper water down towards the tall white tower
on the cape opposite Kawasaki.</p>

<p>Sailor bred, I looked out upon the wide bay
with a sudden rousing from lethargy. Wind,
waves, swelling sails&mdash;all spoke of life and freedom.
If only the majestic <i>Susquehanna</i> might
come steaming around that towered cape! I
could see the grotesque warriors about me scuttling
like crabs before the thunder of the <i>tojin</i> cannon.</p>

<p>But Perry had promised the reluctant Shogunate
many months for deliberation, and I had heard
the report from Nagasaki that the Tai-ping
rebellion was raging in China. I could hope for
no aid either from my own countrymen or the
ships of any other Western power. The lives
and property of white men were endangered at
Shanghai by the Chinese rebels. It was no time
for squadrons to be cruising along the remote
coasts of Japan.</p>

<p>We approached Omori. A group of villagers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
shouted at me in derision, and ran ahead of our
party. Others joined them by the score. The
news spread down the Tokaido. I saw men in
silk robes, white-clad pilgrims, and even priests,
cutting across towards the bay shore. Keiki
turned off the Tokaido. We had come to the
execution ground. The mailed <i>samurais</i> clattered
through the midst of the motley crowd assembled
to gloat upon the torture of the victims. There
were peasants and fishermen, merchants and
porters, cowled priests and pilgrims, and a
scattering of <i>ronins</i>.</p>

<p>But I had no eyes for those who had come to
see me suffer. The Mito men were lining out to
right and left. I was borne past after Kohana
to the edge of the hideous blood pit. Bones
crunched under the iron-shod sandals of my
bearers. All about me the ground was composed
more of the dead of countless executions than of
soil.</p>

<p>Before us stood a heavy post with cross-beams
at top and bottom. A few paces to the left was
a massive gibbet with a chain dangling from its
arm. <i>Eta</i> executioners advanced, bearing a huge
copper kettle, which they swung to the chain
of the gibbet. Oil was poured into the kettle,
and a fire lighted below.</p>

<p>The <i>etas</i> came to my <i>kago</i> and unwound the
nets. But as they dragged me out, Keiki called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
to them. One took up his position beside me,
ready to catch me with a grappling-hook should
I attempt to run. The others went to Kohana’s
<i>kago</i>. She was dragged out and taken to the
cross, which was directly in front of me, less than
six yards away.</p>

<p>The <i>etas</i> tore the robes from about her shoulders.
The first dancer of Yedo stood before the gaping
mob nude to the waist. In a twinkling she was
triced up to the cross, her tender wrists lashed
to the upper arm, her ankles to the lower. An
<i>eta</i> brought a sheaf of slender lances and handed
one to his chief.</p>

<p>The executioner moved around and put the
lance tip to the girl’s side. I knew that his
purpose was to pierce upwards through her body
without striking a vital organ. My eyelids fell.
I could not endure the sight. But again Keiki
interfered.</p>

<p>“Hold!” he commanded, and he rode forward
until between me and the gibbet. “Wait until
the oil is heated. You may miss your thrust.
The girl may not linger long enough to enjoy the
first dipping of the <i>tojin</i> beast.”</p>

<p>“My lord,” protested the <i>eta</i>, “it is known to
you that I have more than once thrust through
two and even three spears from each side, yet
death did not follow until after many hours.
This is one who can endure much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
Keiki did not deign to reply. The executioner
drew aside a step. The crowd pressed closer,
and an oppressive hush fell upon all. The gloating
spectators stared from myself to Kohana and
from her to the great kettle, where the <i>etas</i> were
casting brush and faggots on the fire.</p>

<p>Even the certainty of torture cannot hold the
mind to any one thought for many moments.
I found myself heeding such trifles as the downward
swoop of a flock of gulls and the heat of the midday
sun upon my bare head. I noticed with idle
curiosity that those of the crowd who had pressed
forward on each side were nearly all men of the
lower classes. The upper-class men held back
behind the guards, seemingly ashamed of their
morbid curiosity.</p>

<p>Gazing out over the bay, I began to count the
junks and fishing smacks. Sampans came and
went between the anchored craft. From a junk
that lay opposite us a large sharp-bowed boat
was sculling leisurely shoreward. I flushed with
petulant anger at the thought that here was another
party coming to see us tortured, yet too indifferent
to hasten.</p>

<p>The purring voice of Keiki recalled me to the
horror of the situation.</p>

<p>“The kettle boils,” he called. “Proceed.”</p>

<p>The chief executioner stepped forward with his
spear. I caught a farewell glance from Kohana.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
She raised her face to the sun. I turned my head
aside&mdash;and found myself gazing into the white
face of Azai.</p>

<p>I stared, stupefied. She was wrapped about in
the white dress of a pilgrim, the dress of mourning.
Had she come to die with me? That thought
was more fearful than the thought of death in
the boiling oil.</p>

<p>A man in white behind her looked up, so that
I saw his face under the broad hat brim. My
heart leaped. I was to die a merciful death&mdash;I
and Azai, my wife. Yuki had not failed me!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bared Blades</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap1"><span class="smcap1">A</span> dart whirred past me, to drive
through the mid-body of the executioner
as he bent to thrust his lance.
In the same instant Yuki flung
off his pilgrim robe and leaped at
Keiki with outflashing sword, his burnished armor
glittering in the sun-glare.</p>

<p>Sudden as was the attack, Keiki flung himself
away from the stroke with such quickness that
the blade barely cut through the mail on his
side. Wrenched about by the powerful bit, his
stallion reared above Yuki. Instantly the swordmaster
struck a slashing upward blow that half
severed the beast’s neck at the base.</p>

<p>I saw the stallion rolling over upon his rider&mdash;a
score of Mito warriors were leaping to drive
back Yuki&mdash;I saw Azai darting towards me.
All about me was a wild swirl of shrieking, fleeing
commonfolk, of Mito men yelling and slashing
in blind fury, and crestless warriors, still half
disguised, who had already cut down their own
number of Mito men. I sprang to meet Azai.
The <i>eta</i> with the hook grappled my robe and
dragged me to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
Azai sprang past me. I twisted about and saw
her strike at the stooping <i>eta</i>. The pariah fell
inert, pierced through the nape of his neck. A
mob of yelling, slashing warriors surged about us.
Azai flung herself upon me to shield me with her
tender body. A Mito man fell heavily across us,
the blood gushing from a great wound in his
breast. I heard the triumphant shout of Yuki.
The wave of fighting men surged back.</p>

<p>My bonds parted under Azai’s dirk edge. She
sprang up and tugged with her girlish strength
to help me to my feet. From the bosom of her
robe she plucked out my revolvers, first one and
then the other. As I caught them from her, I
glanced around at the wild <i>mêlée</i>. A group of
Mito men were dragging their lord from under
his horse. The mass were closing in upon my
rescuers, who had rallied with Yuki to drive them
back from me. All told, his followers numbered
less than fifty. Though picked men, they were
falling fast before the overwhelming numbers of
the Mito men. The pikemen in the rear ranks
thrust at them over the shoulders of the Mito
swordsmen.</p>

<p>“My lord! to the shore&mdash;the boat!” cried Azai.</p>

<p>“First free Kohana!” I commanded.</p>

<p>With unquestioning obedience, she ran with me
to the cross and slashed at the bonds of the <i>geisha</i>.
A Mito man charged upon me from the side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
I shot him through the centre of his demonic face
mask. Kohana fell free from the cross. Our
defenders were giving back.</p>

<p>“To the boat!&mdash;to the boat!” I shouted.</p>

<p>“To the boat!” yelled Keiki.</p>

<p>I thrust Azai and Kohana before me, to rush
past the kettle gibbet. Our defenders came
backing after us, now rallying, now retreating.
Keiki’s voice called from the midst of the Mito
men, and half a hundred came charging around to
flank and head us off. I began to fire. But the
Mito men were not to be stopped by my balls.
They rushed in upon us. I drew Azai back.
Kohana was too quick for me. She sprang aside to
the gibbet. An oil dipper was lying upon the
ground. She caught it up and dipped into the
boiling oil. With a skilful sweep she dashed
the seething fluid into the faces of the foremost
warriors. Shrieking in agony, they turned to
fly. Again the girl dipped and flung, and again,
in quick succession. The Mito leaders plunged
back amongst those behind, in wild panic.</p>

<p>Another ladle lay beside the kettle. I caught it
up and helped fling out the oil at those who would
have boiled me in it. The Mito men of the
flanking party turned and rushed back among
those who were engaged in furious struggle with
our defenders, throwing them into momentary
confusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
The moment was not lost by Yuki. At his
shout, our men closed about us. The ladles were
taken from Kohana and me, and we were swept
forward with Azai. The Mito men, charging
after us, were again thrown into confusion by
ladlefuls of seething oil. They spread out on
either side to close around us. But we had gained
a slight start.</p>

<p>A few yards offshore I saw waiting the large
scullboat. Naked rowers stood ready at their
long sweeps. The shoreward gunwale was lined
with women, dressed in black robes and stiff
black hats and armed with halberds.</p>

<p>The Mito men closed in again upon our rear and
flanks, and sought desperately to push forward and
head us. Our men fought them off with still
greater desperation. The shore was not far.
Five and twenty men were left when we gained
the beach and splashed down into the water.
Yuki, though severely wounded, yet fought best
of all, spurring his fellows to superhuman efforts
with his cries.</p>

<p>Down the beach with us plunged the Mito men,
goaded on by the furious commands of their lord.
I caught a glimpse of his bright-armored figure
upborne between two of his retainers. But my
pistol ball glanced on the shoulder-piece of a
warrior who leaped before him down the bank.
Azai slipped upon the slimy clay bottom. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
caught her up and plunged forward, dragging
Kohana by the arm.</p>

<p>On either side of us Mito warriors and our own
men fell maimed into the muddied water, to
flounder and drown. A dozen of the enemy dashed
ahead to board the boat. The <i>samurai</i> women,
led by O Setsu San, screamed defiance and struck
at the mailed warriors with skilful blows of their
halberds. Only two of the enemy gained the side
of the boat. Both were overtaken and cut down
by the foremost of our party.</p>

<p>Almost outspent, we floundered forward through
the knee-deep water to the boat. O Setsu San
and her <i>samurai</i> women beat off the Mito men with
their halberds while we clambered aboard. I
swung Azai and then Kohana over the gunwale,
and vaulted in after them. A few of our men were
in before me. Such of the others as had not
fallen came staggering alongside, all wounded.
The stronger ones paused to meet the furious
attempt of the Mito men to overwhelm them and
capture the boat.</p>

<p>The women whirled their halberds, the naked
oarsmen beat at the Mito men with their sweeps.
I fired every cartridge that remained in my revolvers,
and shouted for all to climb aboard. Those
already in the boat stood with brandished swords.
Those in the water turned to clamber over the
gunwale. The Mito men rushed after. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
women redoubled their blows. Yuki still stood
with his face to the enemy, and shouted to the
oarsmen to back offshore. The brave man meant
to stand where he was and guard our retreat
until cut down. I reached over and dragged him
alongside.</p>

<p>The boat had begun to back water under the
powerful strokes of the scullers. Finding that
I would not release him, Yuki turned and leaped
aboard. I caught up the sword of a man who lay
dying, and thrust out at the Mito men as they
grasped at the boat’s bows. Yuki and such of
his men as could still fight beat at the enemy,
slashing through the mailed arms that sought
to hold the boat. But the brave women did far
more with their halberds.</p>

<p>With a cry of triumph, we beat off the last
Mito man and swept clear. I glanced about and
saw Azai fling down a halberd to kneel beside
one of the wounded men. O Setsu and Kohana
and all the other women dropped their halberds to
follow the example of their mistress.</p>

<p>Yuki sheathed his hacked sword and sank down
before me, the blood oozing through his riven
armor.</p>

<p>“My lord,” he murmured, “Owari could not
strike, but <i>ronins</i> could. Your august father gave
me the best swordsmen of the clan. It is for my
lord to win his way over the sea to Kagoshima.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
Satsuma-no-kami pledges shelter to my lord and
his wife, the Shogun’s daughter. Farewell, my
lord! I go now.”</p>

<p>He sank prostrate at my feet. At my cry,
Azai darted to me, and after her O Setsu. Other
women aided them to strip off the broken armor.
They would save him if he might be saved.</p>

<p>I sprang up to order the boat brought about.
The Mito men had floundered after us till the
water came to their armpits. They could come
no farther. No man could swim in armor
such as weighted them down. At my command
the scullers brought the boat around, bows on,
and headed her for the nearest junk. She drove
forward, out across the dancing whitecaps, at
racing speed.</p>

<p>Aboard the junk the crew was shortening cable,
ready to weigh anchor and set sail. One of the
wounded men called to me and pointed to the
shore. Mito warriors, stripped of their armor,
were running swiftly towards Yedo. Others
waved banners and garments, in frantic efforts
to signal the many passing junks and boats. A
fishing smack sheered out of its course to intercept
us, but bore off again at sight of our bared
blades.</p>

<p>We raced on, the long sculls bowing under the
powerful strokes of the rowers. These men, too,
were Owari retainers. They stood in their places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
and thrust at the handles of their sweeps with
their broad chests, rejoiced to serve him who had
been the chief of the clan.</p>

<p>The poop of the junk reared high before us.
The hope in my heart rose to a certainty. There
was no gaping hole in the stern of the clumsy
craft. She was one of the junks that the Shogunate
had sought to convert into a warship. I
remembered that my clan had offered to equip
and man part of the fleet.</p>

<p>We shot alongside. Lines were flung to us and
made fast. The rowers helped us lift the disabled
warriors up over the low bulwarks amidships,
while the junk’s crew weighed anchor and hoisted
their great square sail. Two men had died of
their wounds. But Yuki still breathed. He was
lifted aboard and carried into the cabin, followed
by Azai and O Setsu and Kohana.</p>

<p>As the ship came about, the crew shouted and
pointed up the bay. A squadron of war-junks
and guard-boats were bearing down upon us.
The women were all aboard. I scrambled after
with the rowers. Stones were flung down into the
boat to scuttle her, and she was cast adrift with
the two dead men.</p>

<p>With the monsoon blowing fresh on her port
quarter, the junk was already beginning to run
down the bay at a rate that surprised me. The
bronzed skipper came pattering down from beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
his huge tiller to kowtow to his august lord. I
ordered him to rise and come aft with me up on
the high poop.</p>

<p>The pursuing squadron had ceased to gain on
us as at the first. Most of the craft were falling
astern, but one at least was still creeping up on
us. The skipper admitted that she was slightly
the better sailer on the wind, and that she carried
a number of bronze pieces. His own cannon had
not yet been shipped.</p>

<p>A few inquiries brought me the information that
he had aboard spare sailcloth and spars. Within
the minute I had his crew rigging jibs and staysails.
There was no time to cut and sew canvas. The
sheets were knotted and rigged in a manner to
shame a marine. Yet even the first jib that was
set drew enough to offset the difference in the speed
of our foremost pursuer.</p>

<p>After jibs followed staysails, and last of all,
studding-sails. The junk heeled over under the
freshening wind and drove down the bay at a
speed that astonished the incoming craft. Finding
themselves fast falling astern, our pursuers opened
fire with their feeble carronades. We cheered,
and hauled to our peak the first national flag
authorized by the Shogunate,&mdash;a red ball on a
white field.</p>

<p>The many craft which we met or passed mistook
the firing of our pursuers for salutes and cheered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
us as we drove by in our swift flight. Within
two hours we were flying past the outjutting point
on the east coast which had given Yoritomo and
me so much concern that wild night in June.</p>

<p>We stood boldly on down past the cape above
Uraga. In the narrower waters of the bay between
us and Cape Sagami, government guard-boats
sculled to and fro in vigilant patrol. We drove on
past Uraga without putting in, as the regulations
required. Guard-boat signalled to guard-boat.
They sculled swiftly athwart our course, signalling
for us to lay to. Some we slipped past; others
backed water to escape being run down, firing at
us with their ineffective swivels. Two managed
to strike in alongside. But we cut loose their
grappling-hooks before their crews could board us.</p>

<p>By mid-afternoon we cleared the last of the
guard-boats off Cape Sagami. Before us opened
the broad gulf of the outer bay, beyond which
rolled the illimitable expanse of the Pacific,&mdash;the
broad lap of Freedom! We had won our way out
of the clutches of Mito.</p>

<p>I set our course between the smoking mass of
Vries Island and the distant coast of Idzu and
ordered the studding-sails struck. We had now
only to coast down Hondo and Shikoku and
Kyushu to Cape Satanomi before the steady drive
of the northeast monsoon,&mdash;a rough voyage
against the Japan Current in any craft, yet one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
fairly safe at this season even for our unwieldy
junk. The typhoon season was past.</p>

<p>I went down into the cabin, where mats had
been laid and silk drapes hung for the son of
Owari. There, alone in the largest room, I found
the Shogun’s daughter, waiting to salute and serve
her lord. She kowtowed before me, her forehead
upon her tiny hands. I bent and caught her up
in my arms, and pressed my lips upon her little
mouth, after the manner of the <i>tojins</i>.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV&mdash;<span class="smcap">Conclusion</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> last page of my narrative is finished.
I lay it aside with the others and
gaze out through the open balcony
of my tower room upon the majestically
beautiful stretch of Kagoshima
Bay. From this pagoda eyrie I can look with
equal ease down the blue gulf and upon the gray
roofs of the city beneath the castle height.</p>

<p>There, in the mouth of the inlet, off the volcanic
island in the head of the bay, is the anchorage
where the <i>Sea Flight</i> lay that eventful night for
Fate to send me my brother Yoritomo.</p>

<p>My thoughts wander from the classroom below
me where, as honorable and honored teacher of
the <i>tojin</i> learning, I instruct the young <i>samurais</i>
of my great friend Satsuma. I pass in rapid
review those eventful months in Yedo. I recall
the sacrifice of my dear friend and rejoice to
know that the years promise a maturing of good
fruit from the seed sown by his spirit and watered
with his blood. I recall how even Mito and the
cautious Abe were forced to accept the treaty
they abhorred, by the menace of Perry’s black
ships, in the Spring of fifty-four.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
The brother of the sweetest woman on earth
or in Heaven still sits on the stool of the Sei-i-tai
Shogun. But now Ii Kamon-no-kami the Great
Elder holds the place of Abe, and seconds the
efforts of the wise first consul to Japan, the
American Townsend Harris. Word has come that
the treaty for the opening of ports to commerce
and intercourse will be signed. The Shogunate
and feudalism verge towards their inevitable
fall. But the truth must penetrate to the ears of
our sacred Mikado through the age-old barriers of
ignorance and prejudice. I see a new Japan.</p>

<p>A hand touches my arm with the lightness of
a perching butterfly. I turn and draw to me my
wife, the Shogun’s daughter, and press my lips
upon her coral mouth. So much I have retained
of my <i>tojin</i> manners.</p>

<p>She withdraws her soft arms from about my
neck, and glides back to kneel before her lord
and clap her hands gently. There is no responsive
“<i>Hai!</i>”&mdash;but through the entrance floats a
graceful woman, bearing a blue-eyed baby girl.
Little Azai is handed to her mother, while Kohana
San smiles the greeting she cannot speak, and
kowtows to the master.</p>

<p>A sturdy boy of four rushes in to fling himself
down before his august father in the required
salute. But there is a light not altogether Nipponese
in his lustrous black eyes as he springs up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
tell of his war game with his playmates in the
castle garden.</p>

<p>And O Setsu San? She still attends upon the
Shogun’s daughter when not serving her lord
and husband, the Swordmaster of Kagoshima,
once known as Yuki the <i>ronin</i>. But of the
august Prince of Owari and his quaint and dainty
lady Tokiwa, who for a time I called father and
mother,&mdash;from them I have been cut off as from
the dead.</p>

<p>Kagoshima is far from Yedo, yet even Shimadzu
Nariakira, Daimio of Satsuma, dare not whisper
abroad the secret of my presence among his
counsellors. For Keiki and old Rekko still plot
and intrigue in the capital of my wife’s august
brother, and in Kyoto the Son of Heaven still
dwells in the Past, and in his eyes the hairy <i>tojins</i>
are beasts and demons.</p>

<p>May Ama-terasu, bright Goddess of the Sun,
soon illumine the night of Kyoto with her rays
of truth!</p>
